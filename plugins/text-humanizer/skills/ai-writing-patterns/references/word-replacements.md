## Context-Dependent Replacements

These words are fine in some contexts but overused by AI in others:

**"Ensure"** — Often used by AI where "make sure" is more natural in casual/business writing. Keep "ensure" in formal or legal contexts.

**"Implement"** — AI overuses this for anything involving action. "Implement a morning routine" → "start a morning routine." Keep "implement" for technical/engineering contexts.

**"Optimize"** — Appropriate in technical contexts. AI overuses it metaphorically: "optimize your morning" → "make the most of your morning."

**"Key" (adjective)** — AI loves "key stakeholders," "key takeaways," "key insights." Replace some with "main," "important," "central," or just cut: "key takeaways" → "takeaways."

**"Crucial" / "Critical" / "Essential"** — AI marks everything as urgent. If everything is crucial, nothing is. Use these sparingly and mean it.
