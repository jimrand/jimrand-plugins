# Word & Phrase Replacement Guide

When a word or phrase below appears at high frequency in the text, consider replacing it. These are not banned words — they become tells only through overuse or when they appear in contexts where a human would choose something simpler.

Note: AI vocabulary preferences shift across model versions. Words that were strong signals in 2023-24 (like "delve") may weaken as models are retrained, while new patterns emerge. Weight structural and rhetorical patterns more heavily than individual word occurrences. See `research-sources.md` for the studies behind these lists.

## Copula Avoidance Patterns — Restore Simple Verbs

AI systematically avoids "is," "has," "are," and "was," replacing them with more elaborate constructions. When you spot these, the fix is usually to put the simple verb back.

| AI version | Human version |
|---|---|
| serves as a | is a |
| stands as a testament to | shows, proves, is proof of |
| boasts (an impressive array of) | has |
| features (a wide range of) | has, includes, offers |
| holds significance | matters, is important |
| represents a cornerstone of | is central to, is a key part of |
| functions as | is, works as |
| constitutes a | is a |
| plays a pivotal role in | is important to, shapes, drives |

## Participial Phrase Alternatives

AI overuses "-ing" constructions, especially at the start of sentences. When you see multiple in a short span, restructure most of them.

| AI version | Alternatives |
|---|---|
| Offering X, the company... | The company offers X. / The company's X includes... |
| Building on Y, the team... | The team built on Y. / After Y, the team... |
| Combining A with B, the product... | The product combines A and B. / A and B work together in... |
| Leveraging decades of experience, the firm... | The firm has decades of experience. / With 30 years of... |
| Showcasing a commitment to quality, the brand... | The brand is committed to quality. / Quality shows up in... |

Don't eliminate all participial phrases — one or two in a longer piece is fine. The tell is frequency and clustering.

## AI Transition Phrases — Cut or Replace

| AI transition | What to do |
|---|---|
| Moreover, / Furthermore, | Cut entirely. Start the next sentence without a transition, or use "And" or "Also" if needed. |
| It's worth noting that | Cut. Just state the thing. |
| It should be mentioned that | Cut. Just mention it. |
| Additionally, | Cut or replace with "Also," or just start the sentence. |
| In today's [fast-paced/ever-changing/digital] world | Cut the entire phrase. Start with the actual point. |
| In conclusion, / To sum up, / In summary, | Cut. Just deliver the closing thought. |
| That being said, | Cut, or replace with "But" or "Still." |
| It goes without saying | If it goes without saying, don't say it. Cut. |
| At the end of the day, | Cut, or replace with "Ultimately" if the tone allows. |
| When it comes to | Cut and rephrase: "When it comes to pricing" → "Pricing..." |

## AI Hedge Phrases — Simplify or Cut

| AI hedge | What to do |
|---|---|
| It's important to note that | Cut. The reader decides what's important. |
| One might argue that | Take a stance or cut: "You could say..." or just state the argument. |
| There are several reasons why | Cut and state the reasons directly. |
| It is widely recognized that | Cut. State the claim. If it needs a source, cite one. |
| Studies have shown that | Cite a specific study or cut to the claim. |
| In many cases, | Be specific about which cases, or cut. |
| It can be said that | Cut. Just say it. |

## AI Filler Affirmations — Always Cut

These add no information and signal conversational AI:

- "Great question!"
- "Absolutely!"
- "That's a really interesting point."
- "I'm glad you asked."
- "That's an excellent observation."
- "You raise a valid point."

## Communication Artifacts — Always Cut from Standalone Content

These are traces of chatbot conversation that don't belong in documents, emails, or articles:

- "I hope this helps!"
- "Let me know if you have any questions!"
- "Feel free to reach out if you need anything else!"
- "Let me break this down for you:"
- "Here's what you need to know:"
- "As of my last update..."
- "Based on available information..."
- "There are several key factors to consider:"

If the content will live as a standalone piece (not a chat transcript), these should be removed entirely.

## AI Rhetorical Constructions — Reduce Frequency

These structures are not wrong, but AI uses them at rates well above human writing. If you see multiple in one piece, cut most of them.

| AI construction | What to do |
|---|---|
| Not just X, but Y | Use once per piece at most. Otherwise, rephrase: "X, and also Y" or just "X and Y." |
| While X, it also Y (compulsive balance) | Take a side. Or state both but without the hedging frame. |
| Despite [challenges], [subject] continues to [triumph] | Be specific about the challenges and honest about whether the outcome was actually a triumph. |
| [Subject] is more than just X — it's Y | Usually the "more than just" framing is unnecessary. Just say what it is. |

## AI Modifier Stacking — Reduce to One

When AI stacks adjectives or adverbs, keep the strongest one:

| AI version | Simplified |
|---|---|
| incredibly powerful and remarkably efficient | efficient (or powerful — pick one) |
| truly exceptional and outstanding | exceptional |
| highly innovative and cutting-edge | innovative |
| comprehensive and thorough | thorough |
| significant and substantial | significant |
| clear and transparent | clear |

## Context-Dependent Replacements

These words are fine in some contexts but overused by AI in others:

**"Ensure"** — Often used by AI where "make sure" is more natural in casual/business writing. Keep "ensure" in formal or legal contexts.

**"Implement"** — AI overuses this for anything involving action. "Implement a morning routine" → "start a morning routine." Keep "implement" for technical/engineering contexts.

**"Optimize"** — Appropriate in technical contexts. AI overuses it metaphorically: "optimize your morning" → "make the most of your morning."

**"Key" (adjective)** — AI loves "key stakeholders," "key takeaways," "key insights." Replace some with "main," "important," "central," or just cut: "key takeaways" → "takeaways."

**"Crucial" / "Critical" / "Essential"** — AI marks everything as urgent. If everything is crucial, nothing is. Use these sparingly and mean it.

**"Core" (adjective)** — AI uses this increasingly as a modifier: "core values," "core functionality," "core principles." Often replaceable with "main" or just cut entirely: "core values" → "values."
