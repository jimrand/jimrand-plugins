# Creative / Design Resume

## What This Document Is

A visually designed document for creative professionals — graphic designers, UX/UI designers, art directors, marketing creatives, social media managers, and similar roles at agencies, studios, and creative-focused companies. Unlike all other resume types, the creative resume IS a design portfolio piece: how you format and present the document is part of your evaluation. The resume works alongside (and is secondary to) a portfolio website or case study collection.

## Required Sections

Section order is flexible — layout is a design decision:

1. **Header / Identity** — Name, contact info, portfolio URL (prominently placed). The header itself is a design element.
2. **Professional Summary / Statement** — 2-3 sentences establishing creative identity and specialization. May use first person.
3. **Work Experience** — May use non-traditional layouts (timeline, cards, infographic):
   - Company/client name, role, dates
   - Key projects and their outcomes
   - Creative tools and methodologies used
   - Client or campaign names (if public/publishable)
4. **Skills** — May be presented visually (skill bars, icon grids, tag clouds). Should include:
   - Design tools (Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, After Effects, etc.)
   - Methodologies (design thinking, user research, A/B testing, brand strategy)
   - Technical skills (HTML/CSS, prototyping, motion graphics)
5. **Education** — Design school, relevant degrees, continuing education
6. **Portfolio Link** — The most important element. Must be prominently placed and functional.

## Optional Sections

- Awards and recognition (ADDYs, Webby, D&AD, Communication Arts)
- Selected clients / brands
- Publications or speaking engagements
- Personal projects or side work
- Social media presence (if relevant to the role)

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 1 page. The resume is a summary; the portfolio is the full story.
- **Format**: Designer's choice. Single-column, multi-column, infographic, timeline — the layout IS the evaluation. However, the information must still be findable and readable.
- **Design elements**: Color, typography, layout, iconography, custom graphics are all appropriate and expected.
- **Typography**: Custom or distinctive font choices demonstrate design sensibility. But readability must not suffer.
- **File format**: PDF (designed/exported from design tool, not word-processed).

**CRITICAL: ATS-incompatible by design.** Creative resumes are intended for direct human delivery — email attachments, portfolio websites, in-person handoffs. Candidates MUST maintain a separate ATS-compatible (plain text, single-column) version for online applications.

## Content Rules

**The resume IS a portfolio piece.** Layout, typography, color palette, and visual hierarchy are evaluated. A poorly designed creative resume suggests poor design skills. A beautifully designed resume with weak content is also a failure.

**Portfolio link is non-negotiable.** The resume is an appetizer; the portfolio is the meal. If the portfolio link is broken, missing, or leads to an empty site, the resume fails regardless of its design.

**Show creative judgment.** The design choices should be appropriate to your target: a resume for a branding agency should look different from one targeting a UX research role. Over-designing for a UX role (heavy graphics, low readability) signals poor user-centered thinking.

**Selected work, not exhaustive.** Name 2-4 notable clients or projects per role. Quality and recognition over quantity.

**Appropriate ONLY for creative industries.** This resume format is appropriate for:
- Graphic designers, UX/UI designers, art directors, creative directors
- Marketing creatives, brand designers, social media designers
- Motion graphics artists, illustrators, photographers
- Creative roles at agencies, studios, startups, and tech companies with creative teams

**Explicitly INAPPROPRIATE for:**
- Banking, finance, law, government, medicine
- Most corporate positions (even marketing at conservative companies)
- Any role where ATS submission is the only application method

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Brief, punchy text — Creative resumes use minimal text; short sentences are the style
- First-person voice — Acceptable and sometimes preferred in creative resumes
- Informal or personality-driven tone — Creative resumes can show personality
- Non-standard section ordering — Layout is a design decision

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Generic creative industry buzzwords ("innovative thinker," "creative problem-solver") without portfolio evidence
- "Passionate about design" — The portfolio should demonstrate passion, not the text
- Vague project descriptions ("created engaging content") without naming the client, medium, or outcome
- Modifier stacking ("highly creative and deeply innovative visual storyteller")
- Text-heavy descriptions that contradict the "show, don't tell" principle of design

**False positive guidance:**
- Skill bars or visual skill ratings are a design convention, not a gimmick (though their accuracy is debatable)
- Short bullets (3-5 words) are appropriate for creative resumes — brevity is a design choice
- Client name-dropping is expected and informative, not boastful
- Informal tone is appropriate for this document type

## ATS / Evaluation System

Creative resumes are designed to BYPASS ATS:

1. **Direct delivery** — Email to hiring manager, creative director, or recruiter. The designed PDF is the intended format.
2. **Portfolio review** — The portfolio website is the primary evaluation tool. The resume provides context.
3. **Agency recruiting** — Creative recruiters (The Creative Group, 24 Seven, Aquent) may collect resumes but evaluate portfolios.
4. **Dribbble / Behance** — Some hiring happens through portfolio platform outreach rather than traditional applications.

**CRITICAL: Maintain a separate ATS version.** For online applications through corporate ATS (Workday, Greenhouse), candidates must have a plain-text, single-column, no-graphics version. The designed version is for human delivery; the ATS version is for system submission.

**When evaluated by humans:**
- Design quality is evaluated first (is this person a good designer?)
- Content quality second (do they have relevant experience and skills?)
- Portfolio third (does their work speak for itself?)
- The resume is often viewed for less than 30 seconds before the reviewer clicks the portfolio link

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Junior Designer (0-2 years) | Internships, school projects, freelance | 1 page, projects-heavy, strong portfolio essential |
| Mid-level Designer (2-5 years) | Agency or in-house experience, some client ownership | 1 page, named clients/projects, tool proficiency clear |
| Senior Designer (5-10 years) | Creative leadership, client relationships | 1 page, selective highlights, awards/recognition |
| Art Director / Design Lead (8+ years) | Team leadership, creative direction | 1 page, leadership and team scope, campaign-level work |
| Creative Director (12+ years) | Department/agency leadership, brand strategy | 1 page, organizational impact, marquee clients/campaigns |

## Common Mistakes

1. **No portfolio link** — The single biggest mistake. The resume without a portfolio is incomplete.
2. **Broken portfolio link** — Worse than no link. Test every link before sending.
3. **Over-designed to the point of unreadable** — Visual design must not sacrifice information clarity
4. **Using a creative format for non-creative applications** — Submitting a designed resume through ATS guarantees parsing failure
5. **No ATS-compatible backup version** — You need both versions
6. **Style over substance** — Beautiful layout with vague or missing content
7. **Generic design** — Using a downloaded template without customization signals a lack of design ability
8. **Not tailoring design to target** — A playful resume for a corporate UX role, or a minimalist resume for an agency role, shows poor audience awareness
