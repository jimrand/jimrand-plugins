# Executive Resume

## What This Document Is

A strategic positioning document for C-suite, VP, board-level, and senior leadership candidates. Unlike standard resumes that list experience, executive resumes build a narrative around leadership brand, organizational impact, and strategic vision. The document markets a leader, not a contributor — it answers "what will this person do for our organization?" rather than "what has this person done?"

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, LinkedIn. Location optional (many executives relocate).
2. **Branding Statement** — 3-5 sentences positioning the candidate's leadership identity. This is NOT a summary of experience — it's a forward-looking statement of what the executive brings. May include a branding title that differs from current job title (e.g., "Global Operations Executive" when current title is "SVP Supply Chain").
3. **Core Competencies** — 9-12 leadership domain keywords in a grid format. These signal areas of expertise (P&L Management, M&A Integration, Digital Transformation, Board Relations, etc.) and serve as both ATS keywords and quick-scan anchors.
4. **Professional Experience** — Reverse-chronological with a narrative structure:
   - Company name, title, dates
   - Brief company context (revenue, employees, industry) if not a household name
   - 2-3 sentence scope paragraph describing the role's mandate
   - 4-6 achievement bullets with quantified business impact
5. **Board Memberships & Advisory Roles** — If applicable
6. **Education** — Degrees, executive education programs (Harvard AMP, Wharton, INSEAD, etc.)
7. **Additional** — Speaking engagements, publications, patents, industry awards

## Optional Sections

- Industry affiliations and professional memberships
- Civic and nonprofit board service
- Languages
- Select media mentions or thought leadership

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 2-3 pages. Senior executives with 20+ years may justify 3 pages; never exceed 3.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological with narrative elements. Single-column, clean design. Subtle formatting (thin lines, modest use of color for headers) is acceptable but not required.
- **Font**: Professional and readable. Calibri, Garamond, or similar. 10.5-11pt body.
- **File format**: PDF. Executive resumes are often shared directly by recruiters rather than uploaded to ATS systems.

## Content Rules

**Branding statement is positioning, not summary.** "Operations executive who builds scalable infrastructure for high-growth companies" is positioning. "Experienced professional with 20 years of operations experience" is a weak summary. The branding statement should make a promise about future value.

**Scope-then-achievements structure.** For each role, first establish the scope (what you were hired to do, what you managed, what the business context was), then list achievements that prove you delivered. This narrative approach is more effective than bullet-only formats at the executive level.

**Quantify at the business level.** Revenue growth, cost reduction, market share gains, M&A deal value, headcount growth, geographic expansion. Executive metrics are organizational, not individual task-level.

**Multiple versions are standard.** Executives often maintain 2-3 resume versions targeting different positioning angles (e.g., operations focus vs. transformation focus vs. general management). Each version has a different branding statement and emphasizes different achievements.

**Company context matters.** If the executive worked at a company that isn't widely known, include a brief descriptor: "($2.3B global industrial manufacturer, 8,000 employees)."

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Formal, authoritative tone — executive resumes are expected to convey gravitas
- Branding language in the branding statement — this section is inherently promotional by design
- Strategic vocabulary ("transformation," "scalable," "enterprise-wide") when attached to specific initiatives
- Longer paragraphs in scope descriptions — narrative format is standard at this level

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Empty "visionary leader" self-assessments without supporting evidence
- "Proven track record of driving results" and similar clichés that name no specific result
- Modifier stacking ("highly strategic and deeply innovative global leader")
- Vague claims of transformation without naming what was transformed or the measurable outcome
- Promotional inflation — "revolutionized" a department of 5 people, "transformed" a minor process

**False positive guidance:**
- Branding titles different from actual job titles are standard practice, not embellishment
- Company context lines ("$500M revenue, 2,000 employees") are expected, not padding
- Core competency grids are a legitimate formatting convention, not keyword stuffing
- "Built and led" is a standard executive construction, not a copula avoidance pattern

## ATS / Evaluation System

Executive hiring often bypasses standard ATS:

1. **Executive recruiter sourcing** — Retained search firms (Heidrick & Struggles, Spencer Stuart, Korn Ferry, etc.) source candidates directly. Resume goes to the recruiter first.
2. **Recruiter presentation** — The recruiter reformats and presents a slate of 3-5 candidates to the client. Your resume may be reformatted into the firm's template.
3. **Client review** — Hiring committee or board reviews the slate.
4. **Interview process** — Typically 4-6 rounds with senior leadership and board members.

**When ATS IS involved:**
- Some companies require all candidates to go through their ATS, even executive-level
- Core Competencies grid provides keyword density for ATS parsing
- Standard ATS formatting rules still apply (no columns, parseable fonts, etc.)

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| VP / SVP | Functional leadership, P&L responsibility | 2 pages, functional depth, team-building narrative |
| C-suite (COO, CFO, CTO, CMO) | Enterprise-wide scope, board interaction | 2-3 pages, strategic narrative, board/investor context |
| CEO / President | Full organizational leadership | 2-3 pages, company-level outcomes, vision-setting |
| Board Director | Governance, oversight, strategic guidance | 1-2 page board resume (different format — emphasizes governance experience) |

Board resumes are a specialized subtype: shorter, focused on governance experience, industry expertise, committee service, and diversity of board portfolio.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using a standard resume format** — Bullet-only, no branding statement, no scope paragraphs. Executive resumes need narrative structure.
2. **Listing duties instead of impact** — "Oversaw operations" vs. "Grew revenue from $50M to $120M over 3 years while reducing operating costs by 18%"
3. **Generic branding statement** — "Results-driven leader with a passion for excellence" says nothing. Name your domain, your scale, and your differentiation.
4. **Missing company context** — If the reader doesn't know your employer, they can't evaluate your scope
5. **Too modest** — Some executives understate their impact. If you led a $200M P&L, say so.
6. **Too long** — 4+ page executive resumes signal inability to prioritize and communicate concisely
7. **One version for every opportunity** — A CFO resume and a COO resume should look different even for the same person
8. **Including early-career roles in detail** — Roles from 15+ years ago should be a single line or omitted entirely
