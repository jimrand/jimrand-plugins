# Standard US Private-Sector Resume

## What This Document Is

The default resume format for private-sector job applications in the United States. This is the baseline type — when no specialized format is required, this is what candidates should use. The standard US resume is a concise, achievement-oriented, ATS-optimized document designed for corporate, startup, and general business applications. It emphasizes what you accomplished (not just what you did), is tailored to each application, and follows formatting conventions that both ATS systems and human reviewers expect.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, LinkedIn URL, location (city, state — full address no longer standard)
2. **Professional Summary** (recommended for 5+ years) — 2-4 sentences summarizing experience, specialization, and value proposition. Tailored to the target role. Not an objective statement.
3. **Work Experience** — Reverse-chronological:
   - Job title, company name, location (city, state), dates (month/year)
   - 3-6 bullets per role (more for current/recent, fewer for older roles)
   - Each bullet: [Strong action verb] + [what you did] + [result/impact with metrics]
   - Focus on achievements over responsibilities
4. **Education** — Below experience for anyone with 3+ years of work:
   - Degree, major, university, graduation year
   - GPA only if recent graduate AND above 3.3
   - Honors, relevant coursework (for recent graduates only)
5. **Skills** — Technical skills, tools, platforms, certifications. Tailored to job description keywords.

## Optional Sections

- Certifications & professional development
- Volunteer experience (if relevant to target role)
- Awards & recognition
- Languages
- Professional affiliations

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 1 page for under 10 years experience. 2 pages maximum for 10+ years. The vast majority of private-sector resumes should be 1 page.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological. Single-column.
- **Font**: Clean, professional (Calibri, Arial, Garamond, Helvetica). 10-11pt body, 13-16pt name.
- **Margins**: 0.5-1 inch. Consistent throughout.
- **Design**: No graphics, no photos, no color (or very subtle color for section headers only). ATS-compatible is the priority.
- **File format**: PDF unless the application specifically requests Word.
- **File naming**: "FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf" — professional and findable.

## Content Rules

**Achievements over responsibilities.** "Responsible for managing social media" is a duty. "Grew Instagram following from 5K to 50K in 6 months, generating $200K in attributed revenue" is an achievement. Every bullet should ideally include a measurable result.

**Tailored to each application.** A single generic resume submitted to every job is the most common mistake. The summary, skills section, and bullet emphasis should shift to match the job description's priorities.

**Action verbs that mean something.** "Managed," "Led," "Developed," "Implemented," "Launched," "Reduced," "Increased" — these should be varied and accurate. Avoid "Responsible for" and "Assisted with" as bullet starters.

**Quantification is expected.** Percentages, dollar amounts, team sizes, time savings, efficiency gains. Not every bullet needs a number, but most should. "Improved" means nothing without "by X%."

**Skills section is a keyword bank.** This section serves dual duty: it gives human readers a quick-scan of your capabilities AND provides ATS keyword matches. Tailor it to mirror the job description's technical requirements.

**No objective statement.** The objective statement ("Seeking a challenging role in...") is obsolete. Use a professional summary or omit the section entirely.

**No references section.** "References available upon request" wastes space and is assumed. Do not include.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Action-verb bullet starts — This is standard resume convention, not AI pattern
- Quantified achievements — Expected and encouraged
- Professional summary language — Some formality in summaries is normal
- Parallel bullet structure — Acceptable within reason
- Industry-specific terminology — Expected in targeted resumes

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- "Proven track record of delivering results" — The single most common AI resume cliché
- "Leveraged" as a verb for simple actions — "Leveraged Excel" just means "Used Excel"
- "Spearheaded" in every bullet — One is fine, three is a tell
- "Cross-functional collaboration" without naming the functions or the outcome
- Modifier stacking ("highly motivated, results-driven, detail-oriented professional")
- Generic bullets that could apply to anyone ("Collaborated with team members to achieve goals")
- "Ensured" and "utilized" overuse — AI favorites
- Empty buzzwords: "synergy," "paradigm," "best-in-class," "world-class"
- Vague summary that doesn't name a specific role, industry, or skill ("Experienced professional seeking new opportunities")

**False positive guidance:**
- One use of "spearheaded" or "drove" is fine — it's the clustering that's the tell
- Quantified bullets are encouraged, not suspicious
- "Managed a team of 8" is a fact, not a cliché
- Professional summaries naturally use slightly more formal language than bullet points
- Listing 5-8 skills is standard, not keyword stuffing

## ATS / Evaluation System

Standard US resumes are the primary document designed for commercial ATS:

1. **ATS intake** — Resume uploaded or parsed through systems like Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Taleo, iCIMS, or BambooHR.
2. **Keyword matching** — ATS compares resume keywords against job description requirements. Match percentage may determine initial ranking.
3. **Recruiter screen** — Recruiters spend 6-10 seconds on initial scan. Summary, job titles, company names, and education are scanned first.
4. **Hiring manager review** — Deeper read focused on relevant experience, achievements, and skill match.
5. **Interview loop** — Resume serves as conversation guide during behavioral interviews.

**ATS optimization essentials:**
- Use exact job description language for key skills and qualifications
- Standard section headers ("Work Experience" not "Where I've Made an Impact")
- Single-column layout, standard fonts, no tables or text boxes
- Skills section mirrors job description keywords
- Job titles should match industry norms (don't use internal company titles that don't translate)
- Both acronyms and spelled-out versions for key terms ("Search Engine Optimization (SEO)")

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Entry-level (0-2 years) | Internships, recent graduate | 1 page, education may lead, internship experience |
| Early Career (2-5 years) | Growing responsibility, individual contributor | 1 page, experience leads, 2-3 roles |
| Mid-level (5-10 years) | Team leadership, project ownership | 1 page (stretching to 2 if needed), achievements prominent |
| Senior (10-15 years) | Departmental impact, strategic contribution | 1-2 pages, selective experience, leadership visible |
| Director+ (15+ years) | Organizational scope | 2 pages max, strategic impact, consider executive format |

For Director-level and above, evaluate whether the standard US resume or the executive resume format is more appropriate based on the target role.

## Common Mistakes

1. **No tailoring** — Sending the same resume to every job. The summary and skills should shift per application.
2. **Duties instead of achievements** — "Responsible for managing accounts" vs. "Managed portfolio of 45 accounts generating $3.2M in annual revenue"
3. **No metrics** — The most common weakness in otherwise decent resumes
4. **Objective statement instead of summary** — "Seeking a challenging role" is outdated
5. **Two-column or designed layouts** — Break ATS parsing for standard applications
6. **Exceeding appropriate length** — A 2-page resume for 3 years of experience signals poor editing
7. **Generic skills section** — "Microsoft Office, communication, teamwork" — too vague and not ATS-targeted
8. **Including references or "references available upon request"** — Wastes space
9. **Inconsistent formatting** — Mixed date formats, inconsistent bullet styles, varying indentation
10. **Personal information** — Photo, age, marital status, nationality are not included on US resumes
