# Federal Resume (USAJOBS)

## What This Document Is

A compliance document for US federal government job applications submitted through USAJOBS. Unlike private-sector resumes that market a candidate, federal resumes validate that the candidate meets formal qualification standards defined by OPM (Office of Personnel Management) position classifications. Every section must satisfy "specialized experience" requirements tied to the numeric job series code in the vacancy announcement.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Contact Information** — Full name, address, phone, email
2. **Citizenship** — US citizenship status (required for most federal positions)
3. **Veterans' Preference** — If applicable, with documentation reference
4. **Federal Employment Status** — Current or former federal employee status, highest GS grade held
5. **Work Experience** (last 10 years minimum) — For EACH position:
   - Job title, GS grade/series (if federal)
   - Employer name, full address
   - Supervisor name, phone number, and whether they may be contacted
   - Start and end dates (month/year)
   - Hours worked per week
   - Salary
   - Detailed description of duties and accomplishments
6. **Education** — School name, city/state, degree, major, GPA (if required), date completed, credit hours (if no degree)
7. **Job-Related Training** — Courses, certifications, licenses with dates and hours
8. **Additional Information** — KSA narratives (if not integrated into experience), awards, publications, language proficiency, security clearance

## Optional Sections

- Professional affiliations
- Volunteer experience (especially for competitive service)
- Special qualifications (languages, typing speed, etc.)

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 3-5 pages is standard. Recent Merit Hiring Plan changes may require 2 pages for some positions — check the specific vacancy announcement.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, covering at least 10 years. USAJOBS resume builder is recommended; uploaded resumes must include all required data fields.
- **Character limits**: USAJOBS builder allows 5,000 characters per work experience entry, 2,000 for education course work, and 22,000 for Additional Information.
- **No creative formatting**: Plain text, standard fonts, no columns or graphics.

## Content Rules

**KSA Integration**: Modern best practice integrates KSAs into the work experience section rather than as separate narrative statements. Use the vacancy announcement's KSA language verbatim when describing matching experience. This is NOT keyword stuffing — it's required compliance.

**Paragraph vs. Bullet style**: Federal resumes often use paragraph format for experience descriptions rather than bullets. Both are acceptable, but paragraphs allow more detailed KSA integration.

**Quantification**: Required. Include scope metrics: number of people supervised, budget managed, systems maintained, cases handled.

**Tailoring**: Each application should be tailored to the specific vacancy announcement. Reusing the same federal resume across different job series without modification is a common failure mode.

**Specialized Experience**: The resume must explicitly address the specialized experience requirements stated in the vacancy announcement. HR specialists score against these requirements — implied experience doesn't count.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Formal, bureaucratic language — this is the expected register for federal documents
- Repetitive phrasing that mirrors vacancy announcement language — this is required KSA integration, not AI repetition
- Long, detailed descriptions — length and detail are required, not padding
- Passive voice in certain contexts — some agency conventions prefer it
- "Ensured compliance with..." phrasing — standard federal language

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Generic private-sector buzzwords ("synergy," "leveraged best practices") that don't map to federal competencies
- Vague authority claims without GS-level-appropriate scope
- Modifier stacking ("highly innovative and cutting-edge") — federal language is direct, not promotional
- "Proven track record" and similar private-sector clichés — inappropriate here
- Emotional language or personality flourishes — federal resumes are impersonal documents

**False positive guidance:**
- "Served as" is standard federal phrasing (e.g., "Served as primary point of contact for..."), not copula avoidance
- Long noun phrases describing program names are legitimate (e.g., "Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act implementation program")
- Parallel structure across duties descriptions is expected, not mechanical

## ATS / Evaluation System

Federal resumes are NOT processed by commercial ATS systems. They go through:

1. **USAJOBS initial screening** — Checks basic eligibility (citizenship, veterans' preference, time-in-grade)
2. **HR Specialist review** — Scores resume on a 70-100 point scale against qualification standards. Language must directly address each KSA.
3. **Best Qualified list** — Top-scoring candidates are referred to the hiring manager
4. **Subject Matter Expert (SME) panels** — Some agencies use SME panels for additional screening

**Keyword strategy differs from private sector:**
- Keywords must match vacancy announcement language exactly
- Boolean matching is common — HR specialists search for specific phrases
- NLP-based matching is rare in federal HR systems
- The USAJOBS resume builder fields map to specific scoring criteria

## Career Level Mapping

Federal career levels map to GS grades, not years of experience:

| GS Grade | Equivalent | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| GS-5 to GS-7 | Entry-level | Education may substitute for experience |
| GS-9 to GS-11 | Mid-level | Specialized experience required |
| GS-12 to GS-13 | Senior | Independent expert, may supervise |
| GS-14 to GS-15 | Executive-equivalent | Senior leadership, policy, program management |
| SES (Senior Executive Service) | C-suite equivalent | Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs) required |

SES applications require a completely separate document — the ECQ narrative (5 separate essays, each addressing a specific leadership competency). This is not a resume but is adjacent to the resume process.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Submitting a private-sector resume** — Missing required fields (supervisor info, hours, salary) disqualifies the application
2. **Not tailoring to the vacancy announcement** — Generic federal resumes score poorly
3. **Using private-sector length expectations** — A 2-page federal resume is usually too short to demonstrate specialized experience
4. **Bullet-only format** — While acceptable, bullet points often don't provide enough narrative detail for KSA scoring
5. **Missing quantification** — "Managed a team" vs. "Supervised 12 GS-7 through GS-11 analysts"
6. **Not addressing each KSA** — Every KSA in the vacancy announcement needs explicit coverage
7. **Creative formatting** — USAJOBS builder can't parse columns, graphics, or unusual layouts
8. **Abbreviations without expansion** — Spell out all abbreviations at least once; HR specialists may not know field-specific acronyms
