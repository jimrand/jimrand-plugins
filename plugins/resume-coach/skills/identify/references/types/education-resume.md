# Education / K-12 Resume

## What This Document Is

A certifications-led document for teaching positions at elementary, middle, and high school levels, as well as instructional coaching, curriculum development, and school administration roles. Education resumes are structured around licensure and endorsements because these are legal requirements — a candidate without the correct certifications cannot be hired regardless of experience quality. The document serves both ATS screening (in districts that use it) and direct principal review.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, location (district preference matters in education hiring)
2. **Certifications & Licensure** — Listed first, above education:
   - Professional Educator License (PEL) or state equivalent
   - Endorsement areas with grade-level bands (e.g., "Elementary Education K-6," "Mathematics 5-12," "Special Education LBS1")
   - ESL/bilingual endorsements (increasingly valuable)
   - Administrative endorsements (Principal, Superintendent) if applicable
   - Expiration dates and state(s) of licensure
3. **Education** — Degrees with institution, major, graduation date:
   - GPA if above 3.0 (especially for early-career)
   - Student teaching details: school, grade level, cooperating teacher, dates
4. **Teaching Experience** — Reverse-chronological:
   - School name, district, location
   - Position title, grade level(s), subject(s)
   - Class sizes and student demographics (if relevant)
   - Specific curriculum, programs, or initiatives led
   - Measurable student outcomes (test score improvements, graduation rates)
5. **Professional Development** — Workshops, conferences, continuing education:
   - PD hours or credits earned
   - Specific training programs (e.g., Responsive Classroom, PBIS, Orton-Gillingham)
   - Technology integration training
6. **Skills** — Technology (Google Classroom, Canvas, Smartboard, etc.), languages, specialized methodologies

## Optional Sections

- Coaching / extracurricular advising
- Committee service (curriculum, hiring, school improvement)
- Community involvement
- Publications or conference presentations (for curriculum specialists)
- Awards (Teacher of the Year, National Board Certification)

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 1-2 pages. Early career: 1 page. Experienced teachers (10+ years) with extensive PD: 2 pages.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, certifications leading. Clean, professional.
- **Font**: Standard (Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman). 10.5-11pt body.
- **Design**: Conservative. No heavy design elements — education hiring values substance over style.
- **File format**: PDF or Word (some district ATS systems prefer Word for parsing).

## Content Rules

**Certifications must be current and specific.** Include the exact endorsement name, grade-level band, and state. "Certified teacher" is insufficient — "Professional Educator License, Elementary Education K-6, State of Illinois, expires 2028" is correct.

**Grade-level specificity matters.** Elementary (K-5), middle (6-8), and high school (9-12) teaching are different professions with different skill sets:
- **Elementary**: Emphasize literacy instruction, differentiated instruction, parent communication, classroom management, multi-subject integration
- **Middle school**: Emphasize adolescent development understanding, student engagement strategies, advisory/mentoring, transition support
- **High school**: Emphasize subject-matter expertise, college and career readiness, AP/IB experience, assessment design

**Student outcomes are the strongest bullets.** "Increased 3rd-grade reading proficiency from 62% to 78% on state assessment" is far more compelling than "Taught 3rd-grade reading." Data-driven educators are highly valued.

**Professional development shows growth.** Districts want teachers who continuously improve. List specific PD with dates and relevance to current practice.

**Technology integration is increasingly expected.** List specific platforms (Google Classroom, Canvas, Seesaw, Nearpod) and how you use them, not just that you're "proficient with technology."

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Educational philosophy language ("differentiated instruction," "formative assessment," "growth mindset") — These are standard professional vocabulary, not buzzwords
- Formal professional language in experience descriptions — Expected register
- Parallel bullet structure across teaching positions — Teachers often do similar things at different schools
- Professional development listing — Even if lengthy, this is a standard and expected section

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Generic "passionate about education" or "dedicated to student success" — The most common AI filler in education resumes
- "Fostered a love of learning" without describing how or naming specific strategies
- "Created engaging lessons" without naming the curriculum, methods, or outcomes
- Modifier stacking ("highly innovative and deeply committed educator")
- Vague claims about classroom management without naming specific frameworks or approaches
- "Utilized best practices" without naming which practices

**False positive guidance:**
- "Differentiated instruction" is legitimate professional terminology, not jargon
- Listing multiple endorsements and certifications is required, not padding
- PD sections with 10+ items are normal for experienced teachers
- "Collaborated with grade-level team" is a real and important activity in education

## ATS / Evaluation System

Education hiring varies significantly by district:

1. **Large districts (ATS-driven)** — Applitrack, Frontline (formerly AESOP), TalentEd, or general ATS (Workday). Keyword matching on certifications, endorsements, and subject areas.
2. **Small districts (direct review)** — Principal and superintendent review resumes directly. Personal connections and recommendation letters carry significant weight.
3. **Charter schools** — May use standard ATS or direct application. Requirements may differ from public school (some don't require state certification).
4. **Private schools** — Direct application. Certification may not be required but is valued.

**ATS considerations for education:**
- Certification and endorsement keywords are primary screening criteria
- Grade-level bands (K-6, 5-12) are key search terms
- Subject area keywords (Mathematics, English Language Arts, Special Education) must be exact
- Technology platform names are increasingly searchable keywords

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Student Teacher / Substitute | Pre-certification or initial license | 1 page, education and student teaching central |
| Early Career (1-3 years) | Initial license, developing practice | 1 page, certifications lead, early outcomes |
| Experienced (4-10 years) | Professional license, established practice | 1-2 pages, student outcomes prominent, PD growing |
| Veteran (10-20 years) | Leadership roles, mentoring | 2 pages, leadership and impact, coaching responsibilities |
| Lead Teacher / Dept. Chair | Instructional leadership, curriculum development | 2 pages, leadership focus, school-wide impact |
| Administrator (Principal, AP) | Administrative endorsement, school management | 2 pages, school-wide outcomes, budget/staff management |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Burying certifications below education or experience** — Certifications must lead; they're the legal prerequisite
2. **Missing endorsement specifics** — "Certified teacher" vs. "PEL, Elementary Education K-6, ESL endorsement"
3. **No student outcome data** — "Taught math" vs. "Improved student math proficiency by 12% as measured by district benchmark assessments"
4. **Generic professional development** — "Attended workshops" vs. "Completed 40-hour Orton-Gillingham training for structured literacy instruction"
5. **Not tailoring to grade level** — Sending the same resume for an elementary and high school position
6. **Omitting technology skills** — In 2025-2026, technology integration is expected, not optional
7. **"Passionate about teaching"** as a summary — The most overused and least informative phrase in education resumes
8. **Missing district or school context** — If the school isn't well-known, note demographics, size, or Title I status for context
