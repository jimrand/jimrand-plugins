# Skilled Trades Resume

## What This Document Is

A certifications-led, straightforward document for skilled trades positions including HVAC, electrical, plumbing, welding, carpentry, heavy equipment operation, automotive, and industrial maintenance. Skilled trades resumes prioritize credentials (licenses, certifications, apprenticeship completion) and hands-on capabilities over narrative or promotional language. The document should be information-dense, practical, and direct — reflecting the communication style of the industry.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, location (geographic flexibility matters in trades — indicate willingness to travel if applicable)
2. **Certifications & Licenses** — Listed first, above experience:
   - Journeyman / Master certification with trade and state/jurisdiction
   - Apprenticeship completion (program name, hours completed, dates)
   - Trade-specific certifications:
     - HVAC: EPA 608 (Universal, Type I/II/III), NATE certification, R-410A
     - Electrical: State electrical license (Journeyman/Master), OSHA certifications
     - Welding: AWS certifications (CW, CWI), specific processes (MIG, TIG, Stick, Flux-Core)
     - Plumbing: State plumbing license, backflow prevention certification
     - General: OSHA 10/30, forklift certification, CDL (if applicable)
3. **Skills / Technical Capabilities** — Specific, practical:
   - Tools and equipment operated
   - Systems worked on (commercial, residential, industrial)
   - Code knowledge (NEC, UPC, IMC, local amendments)
   - Blueprint/schematic reading
   - Specific materials and techniques
4. **Work Experience** — Reverse-chronological:
   - Employer name, trade role, location, dates
   - Type of work (residential, commercial, industrial, new construction, service/repair)
   - Scope: crew size, project types, geographic area covered
   - Safety record and compliance
   - Specific accomplishments (projects completed, efficiency improvements, callbacks reduced)
5. **Education & Training** — Apprenticeship program details, trade school, any college. Continuing education and code update training.

## Optional Sections

- Union membership (with local number)
- Equipment list (specific tools and equipment you own or are certified to operate)
- Safety training beyond OSHA (confined space, lockout/tagout, fall protection, First Aid/CPR)
- References (trades hiring often relies on references; "available upon request" or listed directly)

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 1-2 pages. Most trades resumes should be 1 page. Foremen and superintendents with decades of experience may need 2.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, certifications leading. Simple, clean layout.
- **Font**: Standard, readable. 10.5-11pt body. Don't use decorative fonts.
- **Design**: Minimal. No graphics, no color, no design elements. Let credentials speak.
- **File format**: PDF. Some union halls and hiring managers prefer paper copies.

## Content Rules

**Certifications are the resume.** In the trades, your certifications and licenses are your primary qualifications. A Master Electrician license or Journeyman Plumber card is more important than any bullet point. List them prominently and include license numbers where relevant.

**Specificity over generality.** "Experienced HVAC technician" is weak. "EPA 608 Universal certified HVAC technician with 8 years residential and commercial experience, specializing in VRF systems, chiller maintenance, and ductwork fabrication" is strong.

**Safety record is a qualification.** Include safety-relevant information: years without lost-time incidents, safety training completed, OSHA certifications. Contractors and hiring managers view safety consciousness as a core competency.

**Project types and scale matter.** "Installed electrical systems" is vague. "Wired 150+ residential units in new construction (200A panels, LED lighting, smart home pre-wire)" is specific and demonstrates scope.

**Code knowledge is a differentiator.** Mentioning specific code familiarity (National Electrical Code 2023, Uniform Plumbing Code, International Mechanical Code) signals professionalism and ongoing education.

**Tools and equipment are relevant.** Unlike white-collar resumes where "Microsoft Office" is filler, trades resumes benefit from listing specific tools, equipment, and systems you're certified or experienced with.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Straightforward, direct language — Trades resumes should be plain-spoken, and simple phrasing is expected
- List-heavy formatting — Certifications, tools, and skills are appropriately listed
- Repetitive job descriptions across roles — Many trades positions involve similar work; this is accurate
- Short bullet points — Trades bullets are often brief and factual

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- "Leveraged expertise" or "utilized cutting-edge techniques" — Promotional language is out of place in trades resumes
- "Passionate about craftsmanship" — Generic and likely AI-generated
- Modifier stacking ("highly skilled and exceptionally dedicated tradesperson")
- Vague descriptions that don't name specific systems, tools, or certification standards
- "Innovative solutions" in a trades context — Trades value proven methods and code compliance over innovation claims
- Corporate buzzwords transplanted into trades context ("synergized workflow optimization")

**False positive guidance:**
- Listing 10+ certifications is normal for experienced trades professionals, not padding
- Simple, direct language is the expected style, not a lack of sophistication
- Repetitive role descriptions across employers are often accurate
- "Installed," "repaired," "maintained," "troubleshot" are the correct verbs, not generic fillers

## ATS / Evaluation System

Skilled trades hiring rarely uses traditional ATS:

1. **Direct hire by hiring managers** — Most common. Foremen, superintendents, or business owners review resumes directly and make quick hiring decisions.
2. **Union hall dispatch** — For union trades, work is dispatched through the local hall based on seniority, certifications, and availability. Resume may not be the primary hiring document.
3. **Staffing agencies** — Trade-specific staffing agencies (Tradesmen International, PeopleReady Skilled Trades) may use basic ATS for intake.
4. **Large contractor ATS** — Major construction companies (Turner, Skanska, etc.) may use ATS for project-based hiring.
5. **Word of mouth / referrals** — A significant portion of trades hiring happens through professional networks and referrals.

**When ATS IS involved:**
- Certification names are the primary keywords (EPA 608, OSHA 30, Journeyman Electrician)
- Trade-specific terms (NEC, VRF, PLC, SCADA) are searchable
- Location and willingness to travel are screening criteria

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Apprentice (Year 1-4) | In training, pre-journeyman | 1 page, apprenticeship program, skills developing |
| Journeyman | Completed apprenticeship, licensed | 1 page, certifications prominent, project types listed |
| Master Tradesperson | Advanced license, can pull permits | 1 page, master license prominent, specializations |
| Foreman / Lead | Crew supervision, job-site management | 1-2 pages, crew size and project scope, safety record |
| Superintendent / PM | Multi-site, project management | 2 pages, project scale, budget management, team building |
| Business Owner / Contractor | License holder, business operator | 1-2 pages, business metrics, licenses held, project portfolio |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Burying certifications below experience** — Certifications must lead in trades resumes
2. **Vague descriptions without trade specifics** — "Did electrical work" vs. "Performed commercial electrical installation: 480V 3-phase, motor controls, PLC wiring, conduit bending (EMT, rigid, PVC)"
3. **Missing license numbers or states** — Include jurisdiction, especially if applying out-of-state
4. **Omitting safety record** — Safety is a core qualification in the trades
5. **Promotional language** — Trades hiring managers value directness over polish
6. **Not specifying residential vs. commercial vs. industrial** — These are different skill sets and different markets
7. **Listing outdated certifications** — Expired OSHA cards or lapsed licenses should be updated or removed
8. **Over-designed resume** — Fancy formatting signals unfamiliarity with the industry's values
