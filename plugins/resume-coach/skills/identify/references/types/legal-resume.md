# Legal Resume

## What This Document Is

A concise, credentials-driven document for attorney positions at law firms, government agencies, public interest organizations, and in-house legal departments. Legal resumes emphasize credentials (bar admissions, clerkships, law school, law review) over skills or personality. The document follows strict conventions that vary by hiring context — BigLaw OCI recruiting, lateral hiring, public interest, and government each have distinct expectations.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, address (some markets still expect full address)
2. **Bar Admissions** — Listed prominently, near the top. State(s) admitted, year of admission. Pending admissions noted as such.
3. **Education** — Law school first, then undergraduate:
   - Law school: name, degree (J.D.), graduation year, honors (magna cum laude, Order of the Coif), GPA/class rank (if top third), law review/journal membership and position, moot court
   - Undergraduate: name, degree, major, graduation year, honors (if notable)
4. **Clerkships** — If applicable, listed between education and experience. Judge name, court, term. Future clerkships with accepted dates included.
5. **Legal Experience** — Reverse-chronological:
   - Firm/organization name, title, location, dates
   - Practice area focus
   - Brief description of representative matters (respecting confidentiality)
   - Pro bono work may be integrated or listed separately
6. **Publications** — Full legal citations (Bluebook format for US)

## Optional Sections

- Languages (especially for international practice)
- Pro bono (if not integrated into experience)
- Professional affiliations (bar associations, specialty sections)
- Presentations / CLE teaching

## Length & Format Rules

- **One page strict** for associates and most lateral candidates. Exceptions: public interest attorneys with pre-law-school careers, senior counsel, or partners.
- **Partners**: May use 2 pages to include client development, representative matters, and speaking engagements.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, single-column, conservative.
- **Font**: Times New Roman is the convention. 10-11pt body.
- **Design**: No design elements whatsoever. No color, no lines, no graphics. Conservative presentation signals judgment.

## Content Rules

**No skills section.** Legal competence is demonstrated through credentials, experience, and publications — not a self-reported skills list. A skills section signals unfamiliarity with legal resume conventions.

**Confidentiality in matter descriptions.** Describe practice areas and types of matters handled without naming clients or specific deals unless the matter is public. "Represented a Fortune 500 technology company in a $2B acquisition" not "Represented Apple in the Beats acquisition."

**Clerkship conventions.** List the judge's full name, court, and term. If the clerkship is in the future (accepted but not yet started), list it with the future dates. Multiple clerkships are listed in reverse-chronological order.

**Publications must use proper citation format.** Bluebook for US legal publications. Full citations, not abbreviated. This demonstrates attention to legal formatting standards.

**Law review membership and position matter.** "Articles Editor, Harvard Law Review" carries significant weight. List the specific position held.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Formal, precise legal language — this is the expected register
- Dense credentials listing — standard for the field
- Passive constructions in matter descriptions — common in legal writing ("Represented clients in..." rather than active voice)
- Conservative, understated tone — legal resumes are deliberately restrained

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Promotional language ("passionate advocate," "dynamic litigator") — inappropriate for legal resumes
- Vague practice descriptions ("handled various matters") — should name practice areas specifically
- Modifier stacking ("highly experienced and deeply skilled") — legal resumes are factual, not promotional
- "Proven track record" or similar clichés — out of place in legal context
- Self-characterizations of skill ("excellent legal writing") — let credentials speak

**False positive guidance:**
- "Represented" and "Advised" as bullet starters are standard legal language, not repetitive
- Listing multiple bar admissions is credentials reporting, not padding
- Dense formatting with narrow margins is standard for one-page legal resumes
- Matter descriptions that sound similar are often legitimately describing similar work across different clients

## ATS / Evaluation System

Legal hiring largely does NOT use commercial ATS systems:

1. **On-Campus Interviewing (OCI)** — For law students: bidding system through law school, firms review resumes directly. School, GPA, law review, and clerkships are primary screens.
2. **Lateral hiring** — Through legal recruiters (headhunters) who present candidate packets directly to hiring partners. Resume goes through the recruiter, not an ATS.
3. **Government legal** — USAJOBS for federal (DOJ, SEC, etc.) with federal resume requirements. State/local varies.
4. **Public interest** — Direct application, often through organization-specific portals. Committee review.
5. **In-house** — May use corporate ATS (Workday, etc.) since legal is a department within the company.

**When ATS IS involved (in-house):**
- Standard ATS rules apply
- Bar admission state is a key keyword
- Practice area keywords matter (M&A, litigation, IP, regulatory, etc.)
- Law school name and graduation year are screening criteria

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Law Student / Judicial Clerk | Pre-admission, clerkship | 1 page, education-heavy, law review, moot court |
| Junior Associate (1-3 years) | Recently admitted, developing practice | 1 page, credentials prominent, matter types listed |
| Mid-level Associate (4-6 years) | Developing expertise, some autonomy | 1 page, practice area focus clear, representative matters |
| Senior Associate (7+ years) | Pre-partner, client responsibility | 1 page, leadership in matters, business development hints |
| Counsel / Of Counsel | Specialist, not on partner track | 1 page, deep expertise, publications/speaking |
| Partner | Client relationships, revenue generation | 1-2 pages, representative matters, client development |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Including a skills section** — Signals unfamiliarity with legal resume conventions
2. **Exceeding one page** (for associates) — Shows poor judgment about brevity and relevance
3. **Naming confidential clients** — Serious professional ethics issue
4. **Incorrect citation format** — Using APA or informal citations for legal publications
5. **Promotional language** — "Passionate," "dynamic," "innovative" are inappropriate on legal resumes
6. **Omitting bar admissions** — Or burying them at the bottom instead of near the top
7. **Design elements** — Color, graphics, or creative formatting signals poor judgment for the profession
8. **Generic matter descriptions** — "Worked on various corporate transactions" vs. "Advised on 15+ M&A transactions ranging from $50M to $3B in the technology and healthcare sectors"
