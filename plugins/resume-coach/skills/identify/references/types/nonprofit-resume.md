# Nonprofit / NGO Resume

## What This Document Is

A mission-aligned, metrics-driven document for positions at nonprofit organizations, NGOs, foundations, and social enterprises. Nonprofit resumes bridge two worlds: they must demonstrate the business skills that keep organizations running (fundraising, operations, financial management) while conveying genuine mission alignment and community orientation. The document includes organization context that for-profit resumes typically don't need.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, LinkedIn, location
2. **Professional Summary** — 2-3 sentences connecting your experience to the mission area. This section should convey both competence and commitment without sounding performative.
3. **Professional Experience** — Reverse-chronological. For each role:
   - Organization name **[brief descriptor in brackets]** — e.g., "Habitat for Humanity Greater Chicago [affordable housing nonprofit, $8M annual budget, 45 staff]"
   - Title, dates
   - 4-6 achievement bullets with metrics
   - Fundraising metrics, program outcomes, and community impact emphasized
4. **Education** — Degrees, relevant coursework (nonprofit management, public administration, social work)
5. **Skills** — Grant writing, donor management systems (Salesforce NPSP, Raiser's Edge, Bloomerang), program evaluation, volunteer management
6. **Certifications** — CFRE (Certified Fund Raising Executive), CGWS (Certified Grant Writing Specialist), CNP (Certified Nonprofit Professional), or similar

## Optional Sections

- Board service (especially for senior roles)
- Volunteer experience (if demonstrating mission commitment before entering the sector)
- Publications / speaking (on sector topics)
- Languages (especially for international development)
- Professional affiliations (AFP, ARNOVA, etc.)

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 1-2 pages. Executive directors and senior leaders may justify 2 pages.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological. Clean, professional.
- **Font**: Standard professional fonts. 10.5-11pt body.
- **Design**: Conservative but warm. Subtle formatting acceptable. Avoid corporate rigidity.
- **File format**: PDF.

## Content Rules

**Organization descriptions in brackets are expected.** Because many nonprofits aren't household names, include a brief descriptor after each employer: mission area, budget size, staff size, geographic scope. This gives the reader context without requiring them to look up each organization.

**Fundraising metrics are essential.** For development roles: dollars raised annually, number of donors managed, donor retention rate, average gift size, grant success rate, major gifts closed. For other roles: program budget managed, grants administered. The sector is increasingly data-driven.

**Program outcomes matter as much as activity.** "Managed the after-school program" is activity. "Managed after-school program serving 200 students, achieving 95% daily attendance and 15% improvement in reading scores" is outcome. Lead with outcomes.

**Mission alignment language is appropriate.** Unlike for-profit resumes where "passion" language is often filler, nonprofit resumes legitimately use mission-aligned language. "Committed to housing equity" or "focused on food access in underserved communities" is appropriate when backed by relevant experience. The line is between earned alignment (demonstrated through work) and performative alignment (stated without evidence).

**CFRE and similar certifications carry real weight.** The CFRE is the gold standard for fundraising professionals. Including it prominently signals professional credibility in development roles.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Mission-driven language when supported by specific work — "Dedicated to expanding educational access" is legitimate when followed by 10 years of education nonprofit work
- Community-oriented vocabulary ("stakeholders," "constituents," "communities served") — Standard nonprofit terminology
- Impact-focused descriptions — Nonprofits measure and communicate impact; this is expected
- "Collaborated with" board members, donors, community partners — Nonprofit work is inherently collaborative

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Corporate buzzwords transplanted into nonprofit context — "Synergized cross-functional deliverables" doesn't belong
- Performative mission language without evidence — "Deeply passionate about social justice" with no relevant experience
- "Leveraged" and "spearheaded" in contexts that don't warrant them
- Modifier stacking ("highly impactful and transformative community engagement")
- Vague impact claims — "Made a difference in the community" without quantification
- Generic nonprofit language that could apply to any organization — Must be specific to the mission area

**False positive guidance:**
- Organization descriptions in brackets are a legitimate convention, not padding
- Mission language is appropriate in nonprofit resumes when earned through experience
- "Grant writing" and "donor cultivation" are specific professional skills, not buzzwords
- Fundraising numbers (dollars raised, donor counts) are expected, not boastful

## ATS / Evaluation System

Nonprofit hiring uses a mix of approaches:

1. **Standard ATS (larger organizations)** — Organizations with 50+ staff often use ATS systems (BambooHR, JazzHR, Workday). Standard keyword matching applies.
2. **Direct review (smaller organizations)** — Many small nonprofits review resumes directly. Executive director and board involvement in hiring is common.
3. **Search firms (executive roles)** — Executive director and C-suite searches may use nonprofit-specialized search firms (Koya Partners, DRG, Nonprofit Professionals Advisory Group).
4. **Board hiring committees** — ED and senior roles often involve board members in the review process.

**Hiring priorities differ from for-profit:**
- Mission alignment is a genuine screening criterion, not just cultural fit
- Salary expectations must be realistic for the sector
- Board-management dynamic experience is valued for senior roles
- Fundraising capability is often the single most important skill for EDs

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Entry-level / Coordinator | AmeriCorps, internships, program support | 1 page, volunteer experience may supplement |
| Manager (3-7 years) | Program management, team supervision | 1-2 pages, program outcomes and team leadership |
| Director (7-12 years) | Department leadership, budget oversight | 2 pages, fundraising or program metrics, strategic planning |
| VP / CDO / CPO (12+ years) | Organizational leadership, major gifts, strategy | 2 pages, organizational-level impact, board interaction |
| Executive Director / CEO | Full organizational leadership, board relations | 2 pages, fundraising totals, organizational growth, strategic vision |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing organization descriptors** — Reader can't evaluate your experience without knowing the organization's size, scope, and mission
2. **No fundraising metrics** — For development roles, metrics are non-negotiable
3. **Corporate resume format with no mission context** — Nonprofit hiring managers look for sector understanding
4. **Performative mission language without evidence** — "Passionate about equity" means nothing without relevant work
5. **Underselling metrics** — Nonprofit professionals often minimize their quantitative impact; a $2M fundraising year is significant
6. **Listing "volunteer management" without details** — How many volunteers? What systems? What retention rate?
7. **Omitting CFRE or similar certifications** — If you have them, they should be prominent
8. **Ignoring the board relationship** — For senior roles, experience working with or reporting to a board is important to highlight
