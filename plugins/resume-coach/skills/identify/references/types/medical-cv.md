# Medical CV

## What This Document Is

A comprehensive clinical and academic record used for residency applications (via ERAS), fellowship applications, and attending physician positions. Medical CVs serve a dual purpose: demonstrating clinical competence and research capability. The document follows strict conventions that vary by career stage — ERAS format for residency, traditional CV format for attending positions.

## Required Sections

**For residency applications (ERAS format):**

1. **Contact Information** — Name, AAMC ID, email, phone
2. **Education** — Medical school, degree, graduation date. Undergraduate institution, degree, major, graduation date.
3. **USMLE / COMLEX Scores** — Step 1, Step 2 CK, Step 2 CS (if applicable), Step 3 (if completed). Scores and dates.
4. **Clinical Rotations** — Hospital name, specialty, dates, attending physician name
5. **Research Experience** — Lab/PI name, institution, dates, brief description of projects, publications resulting
6. **Publications** — Full citations in Vancouver/ICMJE format. Subdivided: peer-reviewed articles, abstracts, poster presentations.
7. **Presentations** — Conference name, title, date, type (oral/poster)
8. **Volunteer / Community Service** — Organization, role, dates, description
9. **Work Experience** — Non-clinical employment (if relevant)
10. **Hobbies & Interests** — Explicitly expected. 3-5 specific interests with detail.
11. **Awards & Honors**
12. **Professional Memberships** — AMA, specialty societies

**For attending positions (traditional medical CV):**
- Sections shift to emphasize: Board Certifications, Clinical Experience, Academic Appointments, Publications, Grants, Teaching, Administrative Roles

## Optional Sections

- Languages (particularly relevant for community health settings)
- Medical licensure details (state licenses held)
- Quality improvement / patient safety projects
- Teaching evaluations (if strong)
- Media / public health outreach

## Length & Format Rules

- **Residency ERAS**: The ERAS application has specific fields that limit format flexibility. Supplemental CV may be 3-5 pages.
- **Fellowship**: 3-5 pages, research-focused for academic fellowships, clinical-focused for community programs.
- **Attending positions**: 5-15+ pages depending on career stage. No page limit for senior physicians.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological within each section. Clean, single-column.
- **Citation format**: Vancouver/ICMJE style (numbered citations, journal abbreviations).
- **Author name**: Bold your own name in all co-authored publications.

## Content Rules

**USMLE scores are included for residency.** This is unique to medicine — no other field requires standardized test scores on a CV. Include all completed Step scores with dates. If a score is below average, include it anyway — omission is noticed and assumed to be worse than reality.

**Research section must include PI name.** The PI (principal investigator) name provides credibility context. "Research Assistant, Dr. Sarah Chen Lab, Department of Cardiology, Johns Hopkins" is more informative than "Research Assistant, Johns Hopkins."

**Hobbies section is standard and expected.** Unlike almost every other resume type, medical CVs include hobbies and interests. Program directors use these for interview conversation starters and cultural fit assessment. Be specific: "Trail running (completed 3 ultramarathons)" not "Running." "Jazz piano (performed at local venues since 2018)" not "Music."

**Volunteer work matters.** Particularly for residency, volunteer and community service demonstrate the service orientation expected in medicine. Include hours and specific contributions where possible.

**Publications count and quality.** For academic positions, publications are evaluated by journal impact factor, author position (first author, senior author, middle author), and research focus coherence. Quality over quantity, but quantity is also tracked.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Clinical terminology density — Medical CVs legitimately use extensive medical jargon
- Formal, precise descriptions of clinical experience — Standard register
- Passive voice in research descriptions ("The study was designed to...") — Convention in medical writing
- Parallel structure in publication listings — Bibliographic convention
- Dense, information-packed formatting — Expected for medical CVs

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- "Passionate about medicine" or "dedicated to patient care" — Generic and likely AI-generated
- "Comprehensive understanding of..." — Vague competence claims without evidence
- Promotional language about clinical skills ("exceptional bedside manner," "outstanding diagnostic ability")
- Modifier stacking on research descriptions ("groundbreaking and highly impactful research")
- Vague research descriptions without naming specific methods, conditions, or outcomes

**False positive guidance:**
- "Performed" and "Assisted in" are standard clinical descriptors, not weak verbs
- Listing 20+ conference presentations is expected for academic physicians, not padding
- Hobbies section is mandatory, not filler — do not flag its inclusion
- "Managed" in clinical context means actual patient management, not a generic verb

## ATS / Evaluation System

Medical hiring uses specialized systems, not standard commercial ATS:

**Residency (ERAS/NRMP Match):**
1. **ERAS submission** — Standardized application through the Electronic Residency Application Service
2. **Program screening** — Programs filter by USMLE scores, medical school, publications, research experience
3. **Interview invitations** — Programs invite 10-15% of applicants
4. **Interview day** — Multiple interviews with faculty, residents, and program director
5. **Rank list** — Both applicants and programs submit ranked preference lists
6. **Match Day** — NRMP algorithm produces binding assignments

**Fellowship:** Similar ERAS process for most specialties.

**Attending positions:**
1. **Department review** — Search committee reviews CVs
2. **Phone screen** — Department chair or senior faculty
3. **Campus visit** — Grand rounds presentation, clinical observation, interviews
4. **Faculty vote** — Department and division approval

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | CV Expectations |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Medical Student (MS3-MS4) | Pre-residency, clinical rotations | 2-3 pages, rotations and research central |
| Resident (PGY1-PGY5+) | In training, developing specialty | 3-5 pages, growing publications and presentations |
| Fellow | Sub-specializing, research-focused | 4-7 pages, research and publications prominent |
| Junior Attending / Assistant Professor | Early independent practice | 5-10 pages, building clinical and academic record |
| Associate Professor / Senior Attending | Established practice and research | 10-20 pages, grants, teaching leadership |
| Professor / Department Chair | Field leadership, program building | 15-30+ pages, extensive record, administrative roles |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Omitting hobbies section** — This is expected in medical CVs and its absence is noticed
2. **Generic hobbies** — "Reading, traveling" vs. specific interests with detail
3. **Wrong citation format** — Using APA instead of Vancouver/ICMJE
4. **Omitting USMLE scores** (for residency) — Omission is assumed to mean low scores
5. **Not listing PI names** — Research without PI attribution lacks credibility context
6. **Promotional self-assessment** — "Excellent surgeon" or "compassionate physician" — let the record speak
7. **Mixing clinical and research roles without clear delineation** — Keep sections cleanly separated
8. **Failing to update publication status** — "Submitted" papers that were published should show the final citation
