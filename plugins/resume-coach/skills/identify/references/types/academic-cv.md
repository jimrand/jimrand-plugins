# Academic CV

## What This Document Is

A comprehensive scholarly record used for faculty positions, research appointments, postdoctoral fellowships, and academic grants. Unlike a resume, an academic CV is expected to be exhaustive — every publication, presentation, grant, and teaching assignment is listed. Length is a feature, not a flaw.

## Required Sections

Order varies by institution type. **Research university order:**

1. **Contact Information** — Name, institutional affiliation, department, address, email, ORCID
2. **Education** — Degrees in reverse-chronological order with institution, field, year, dissertation title, advisor name
3. **Academic Appointments** — Faculty positions, visiting appointments, postdocs
4. **Publications** — Subdivided by type:
   - Peer-reviewed journal articles
   - Book chapters
   - Books / monographs
   - Conference proceedings (if field-appropriate)
   - Working papers / preprints (marked as such)
   - Works under review / in preparation (marked as such)
5. **Grants & Fellowships** — Funding agency, title, amount (in STEM/business; optional in humanities), dates, role (PI/Co-PI)
6. **Awards & Honors**
7. **Invited Talks & Conference Presentations**
8. **Teaching Experience** — Course listings with enrollment, level (undergrad/grad), evaluations (if strong)
9. **Service** — Department, university, professional (journal reviewing, committee work)
10. **Professional Affiliations**

**Teaching institution order** — moves Teaching to position 3-4, before or immediately after Publications.

## Optional Sections

- Research statement summary (often separate document but sometimes included)
- Media coverage / public scholarship
- Mentoring (graduate students advised, committees served on)
- Software / datasets produced
- Languages
- References (list or "available upon request")

## Length & Format Rules

- **No page limit.** A mid-career professor's CV may be 15-20 pages. A senior professor's may exceed 30.
- **Junior candidates** (ABD, postdoc, early assistant professor): 3-8 pages typical
- **Format**: Clean, single-column, standard academic fonts (Times New Roman, Garamond, or Palatino are conventions)
- **Paper**: A4 for European institutions, US Letter for US institutions
- **Citation format**: Use the standard for your discipline (APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, etc.). Be consistent throughout.
- **Author name**: Bold your own name in all co-authored publications

## Content Rules

**Publications**: Include complete bibliographic citations. Mark the status of unpublished work: "forthcoming," "in press," "under review," "in preparation." Never list "in preparation" works unless the manuscript substantially exists.

**Grants**: STEM and social science fields include dollar amounts. Humanities fields often don't. Follow your discipline's convention. Always list your role (PI, Co-PI, Senior Personnel).

**Teaching**: List each course with course number, title, term, and level. Including enrollment and evaluation scores is optional but recommended if strong.

**Tailoring by institution type**: A CV for a research-intensive university should lead with publications and grants. A CV for a teaching-focused institution should lead with teaching experience and pedagogy.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Formal academic register — "This research examines..." is standard, not AI
- Nominalizations — Some are disciplinary convention (e.g., "operationalization," "conceptualization")
- Passive voice — Standard in many scientific disciplines ("The data were analyzed...")
- Precise, dense language — Academic writing is meant to be information-dense
- Parallel structure in publication listings — This is bibliographic convention

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- "Delve," "landscape," "multifaceted," "holistic" — These ARE AI tells even in academic context
- Research descriptions that use promotional language ("groundbreaking," "revolutionary")
- Teaching descriptions that sound like marketing copy
- Vague research impact claims without citations or metrics
- Modifier stacking in section descriptions

**False positive guidance:**
- "Forthcoming" and "in press" are standard academic status markers, not vague language
- Long noun phrases for research areas are legitimate (e.g., "computational approaches to historical sociolinguistic variation")
- Listing 50+ publications is expected for senior scholars, not padding

## ATS / Evaluation System

Academic hiring does NOT use ATS systems. Evaluation process:

1. **Search committee** reviews all CVs (often 100-300 applications)
2. **Long list** (15-25 candidates) based on research fit, publication quality, and teaching
3. **Short list** (3-5 candidates) invited for campus visits
4. **Faculty vote** after campus visit presentations

**What the committee evaluates:**
- Publication quality (journal prestige, citation counts) over quantity
- Grant funding (especially for research universities)
- Teaching evaluations and breadth
- Service (important for tenure, less so for hiring)
- "Fit" with department needs and research clusters

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | CV Expectations |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| ABD / PhD Candidate | No degree yet, limited publications | 3-5 pages, dissertation research central |
| Postdoc / Visiting | PhD completed, building publication record | 5-8 pages, publications growing |
| Assistant Professor | Tenure-track, pre-tenure | 8-15 pages, strong publication trajectory |
| Associate Professor | Tenured, mid-career | 15-25 pages, established research program |
| Full Professor | Senior, may hold named chair | 20-40+ pages, extensive record |
| Distinguished / Endowed Chair | Top of field | Length varies, prestige items prominent |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using resume conventions** — Bullet points for research descriptions, action verbs for teaching, one-page limit
2. **Missing publication subdivisions** — Lumping all publications together instead of separating by type
3. **Not marking publication status** — "Under review" vs. "in press" vs. "forthcoming" matters
4. **Wrong citation format** — Using APA in a humanities field that expects MLA/Chicago, or vice versa
5. **Omitting grants for STEM** — Grant funding is expected evidence of research viability
6. **Not tailoring for institution type** — Sending a research-first CV to a teaching college
7. **Including "References available upon request"** — In academic hiring, either list references or omit the section entirely
