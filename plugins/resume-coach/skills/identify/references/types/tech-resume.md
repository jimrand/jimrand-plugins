# Tech / Software Engineering Resume

## What This Document Is

A concise, metrics-driven document for software engineering, data science, DevOps, and related technical roles. The resume works alongside a GitHub profile and/or portfolio that provide additional evidence of technical capability.

## Required Sections

1. **Header** — Name, email, phone, location (city/state), LinkedIn, GitHub profile URL, portfolio URL (if applicable)
2. **Professional Summary** (optional for <5 years) — 2-3 sentences positioning the candidate: specialization, scale of work, primary technologies
3. **Skills / Technical Stack** — Curated list of current capabilities organized by category (Languages, Frameworks, Infrastructure, Tools). Only include technologies you could use productively tomorrow.
4. **Work Experience** — Reverse-chronological, metrics-driven bullets. Each bullet should follow: [Action verb] + [what you built/did] + [measurable result] + [technologies used].
5. **Projects** (especially important for junior candidates) — 2-5 projects with:
   - Project name (linked to GitHub repo or live demo)
   - One-line description of what it does
   - Your specific contribution (if team project)
   - Technologies used
6. **Education** — Below experience for anyone with 2+ years of professional work

## Optional Sections

- Certifications (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Open source contributions
- Publications / talks (for senior engineers)
- Patents

## Length & Format Rules

- **<5 years experience**: 1 page, non-negotiable
- **5+ years**: 2 pages maximum
- **Format**: Single-column, clean, no graphics or color. ATS-compatible.
- **File format**: PDF unless specifically requested otherwise
- **Font**: Standard (Calibri, Arial, Helvetica). 10-11pt body, 12-14pt name.

## Content Rules

**Skills section is a current-capabilities list, not a history.** If you'd need significant time to relearn something, leave it off. In 2025-2026, AI/ML tool proficiency is increasingly expected.

**Metrics are non-negotiable.** "Improved API response time by 35% by redesigning the caching layer" not "Worked on improving API performance." "Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes" not "Streamlined the deployment process."

**Technical terminology must be consistent.** "REST API" in one place and "Rest Api" in another signals carelessness. "JavaScript" not "Javascript." "PostgreSQL" not "Postgres" (unless your audience clearly prefers the informal version).

**GitHub links must work and have substance.** Don't link to an empty profile. Repositories should have READMEs, clean code, and ideally tests and CI config. An active, well-maintained GitHub is a significant differentiator.

**Projects section replaces experience for junior candidates.** If you have limited professional experience, 3-5 well-documented projects with live demos or clean repositories demonstrate capability more effectively than describing internship duties.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Technical jargon density — A tech resume legitimately uses many technical terms
- Action-verb bullet starts — This is standard resume convention, not AI pattern
- Parallel bullet structure within a single role — Acceptable in tech resumes
- Acronyms and abbreviations — Standard in the field (CI/CD, API, SDK, etc.)

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- "Leveraged cutting-edge technologies" — Vague tech buzzwords without naming specific technologies
- "Innovative solutions" without describing what was actually built
- "Collaborated with cross-functional teams" without naming the teams or the outcome
- Modifier stacking on technical achievements ("highly scalable and incredibly performant")
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any engineer at any company
- Missing metrics — A tech resume without numbers is likely AI-generated or poorly written

**False positive guidance:**
- Listing 8-10 technologies per role is normal, not keyword stuffing
- "Built," "deployed," "migrated," "refactored" are legitimate technical verbs, not AI tells
- Short project descriptions (1-2 lines) are appropriate — not every item needs 3 bullets

## ATS / Evaluation System

Standard commercial ATS systems (Lever, Greenhouse, Workday, Taleo) with some tech-specific considerations:

- **Technical keyword matching is critical** — ATS filters for specific technologies, not general skills
- **Exact technology names matter** — "React" not "ReactJS" (or include both). "Python" not "python programming language."
- **Certifications are parseable keywords** — AWS Certified Solutions Architect, CKA, etc.
- **GitHub/portfolio links** — ATS systems may not parse these, but human reviewers will click them. Include in plaintext, not hyperlink-only.
- **Projects section** — Some ATS systems don't have a projects field. Consider placing key projects in the experience section with a "Personal Projects" or "Open Source" employer header.

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Junior / New Grad (0-2 years) | Internships, bootcamp, CS degree | 1 page, projects-heavy, education prominent |
| Mid-level (2-5 years) | IC with growing scope | 1 page, experience-focused, some projects |
| Senior (5-10 years) | Technical leadership, system design | 1-2 pages, architecture decisions, mentoring |
| Staff / Principal (10+ years) | Cross-team impact, technical strategy | 2 pages, org-level impact, technical vision |
| Engineering Manager | People management + technical | 2 pages, team metrics, delivery outcomes |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Listing every technology ever touched** — Skills section should reflect current capabilities only
2. **Duty descriptions instead of achievements** — "Responsible for maintaining the API" vs. "Reduced API error rate from 2.3% to 0.1%"
3. **Empty GitHub link** — Worse than no link at all
4. **Inconsistent technology naming** — "JS" and "JavaScript" in different places
5. **No metrics** — The single biggest weakness in tech resumes
6. **Two-column or designed layouts** — These break ATS parsing
7. **Listing outdated technologies prominently** — jQuery expertise in 2026 signals stagnation unless contextually relevant
