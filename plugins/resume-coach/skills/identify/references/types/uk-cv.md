# UK CV

## What This Document Is

A two-page document following British conventions for professional job applications in the United Kingdom. The term "CV" (curriculum vitae) is used for all applications in the UK — there is no distinction between "resume" and "CV" as in the US. The UK CV features a Personal Statement section, uses British spelling and conventions, and follows A4 paper formatting. It balances professionalism with personality through the personal statement.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header / Personal Details** — Full name, phone, email, LinkedIn. Full address is becoming less common (city and postcode is acceptable). Do NOT include date of birth, nationality, marital status, or photo (UK equality legislation discourages these).
2. **Personal Statement / Personal Profile** — 4-6 sentences that introduce the candidate's professional identity, key achievements, and career direction. This is the most distinctive feature of a UK CV and is expected on nearly all applications. Written in third person (traditional) or first person (increasingly accepted).
3. **Key Skills** (optional but common) — 6-8 bullet points highlighting transferable and role-specific skills. Brief, punchy.
4. **Work Experience / Employment History** — Reverse-chronological:
   - Job title, employer name, location, dates (month/year)
   - 3-5 bullets per role with achievements and responsibilities
   - Most recent 2-3 roles in detail; older roles summarized
5. **Education & Qualifications** — Reverse-chronological:
   - University degree(s): institution, degree classification (First, 2:1, 2:2), subject, year
   - A-levels / Scottish Highers: subjects, grades (for early-career; drop after ~5 years experience)
   - GCSEs: summary only ("10 GCSEs including Maths and English at grade A*-C")
   - Professional qualifications (CIMA, ACCA, CIPD, etc.)
6. **Additional Information** — Interests, volunteer work, languages, driving licence

## Optional Sections

- Professional memberships (chartered status carries weight in UK: MRICS, MCIPD, CEng, etc.)
- Publications / conferences
- Volunteer work (if not in additional information)
- References — "Available on request" is standard; listing referees is less common now

## Length & Format Rules

- **Length**: 2 pages. This is a strong convention — 1 page is too brief, 3+ pages is too long for most roles (academic CVs excepted).
- **Paper**: A4 (not US Letter).
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, single-column.
- **Font**: Clean professional font (Calibri, Arial, Verdana). 10.5-11pt body. British convention leans toward sans-serif.
- **Spelling**: British English throughout. "Organised" not "organized." "Analyse" not "analyze." "Programme" not "program" (unless referring to computer programs). "Centre" not "center."
- **Date format**: Month Year (e.g., "January 2024" or "Jan 2024"), not mm/dd/yyyy.
- **Design**: Clean and professional. Subtle formatting acceptable. Avoid heavy design elements.

## Content Rules

**Personal Statement is critical.** This 4-6 sentence section is the most-read part of a UK CV. It should:
- State who you are professionally (role, experience level, sector)
- Highlight 1-2 key achievements or specialisms
- Indicate career direction or what you're seeking
- Be tailored to each application
- Avoid clichés ("hardworking team player," "passionate individual")

**Degree classification matters.** UK degrees are classified: First Class (1st), Upper Second (2:1), Lower Second (2:2), Third. A 2:1 or above is the standard expectation for graduate schemes. Include classification for at least the first 10 years of career.

**Chartered status carries weight.** In many UK professions, chartered status (MRICS, MCIPD, CEng, ACCA, etc.) is a significant differentiator. List it prominently after your name or in a qualifications section.

**Interests section is expected.** Unlike US resumes where interests are often omitted, UK CVs typically include a brief interests section. Keep it specific and genuine — it's used for interview conversation and cultural fit.

**No photo, no age, no nationality.** UK equality legislation (Equality Act 2010) makes it best practice to omit personal characteristics. Age, gender, marital status, nationality, and photo should not appear.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Formal professional language — Standard UK CV register
- Personal statement section — This IS an expected section, not unnecessary self-promotion
- British spelling patterns — "Organised," "analysed," "behaviour" are correct
- "Whilst" and "amongst" — Standard British English, not archaic AI tells
- Structured bullet points — Expected format

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Generic personal statement clichés — "Highly motivated individual with a proven track record" is the most common AI tell in UK CVs
- "Hardworking team player with excellent communication skills" — Generic and signals AI
- "Passionate" without evidence — Overused in UK CV personal statements
- American spelling mixed with British — Signals AI that wasn't configured for UK English
- "Leveraged" and "synergized" — American corporate jargon inappropriate in UK context
- Modifier stacking in the personal statement — Should be confident but not inflated

**False positive guidance:**
- "Whilst," "amongst," "behaviour" are correct British English, not unusual word choices
- Personal statement in third person ("An experienced marketing professional who...") is a legitimate UK convention
- Including interests is expected, not filler
- "Programme" (not "program") is correct British spelling for non-computing contexts

## ATS / Evaluation System

UK hiring uses a mix of ATS and direct review:

1. **Large employers (ATS-driven)** — Major UK companies, NHS, Civil Service use ATS systems (Workday, Oracle, Taleo, Tribepad). Keyword matching and scoring apply.
2. **Recruitment agencies** — UK hiring relies heavily on recruitment agencies (Hays, Robert Walters, Michael Page, Reed). Agencies input CVs into their own databases.
3. **Direct application (SMEs)** — Smaller companies often review CVs directly via email.
4. **Civil Service (Success Profiles)** — UK Civil Service uses the Success Profiles framework with specific competency-based assessment. CVs are evaluated against the framework behaviors, strengths, and technical skills.
5. **Graduate schemes** — Structured application processes with online forms, psychometric tests, and assessment centres. The CV may be supplementary.

**ATS considerations for UK CVs:**
- Standard ATS parsing rules apply (single-column, parseable fonts, no graphics)
- British spelling must match job description keywords (search for "organisation" not "organization")
- Chartered designations and professional qualifications are high-value keywords
- Postcode / location is used for commute filtering

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | CV Expectations |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Graduate / Entry (0-2 years) | University degree, internships | 2 pages, education detailed (A-levels, degree classification), personal statement essential |
| Early Career (2-5 years) | Developing professional experience | 2 pages, experience growing, degree classification still listed |
| Mid-Career (5-15 years) | Established professional, possibly chartered | 2 pages, experience-heavy, chartered status prominent |
| Senior (15+ years) | Leadership, strategic responsibility | 2 pages, selective experience, board/committee membership |
| Director / C-suite | Organizational leadership | 2 pages, strategic scope, non-executive roles |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing personal statement** — The most distinctive and expected section of a UK CV
2. **American spelling** — "Organized," "analyzed," "center" signal lack of attention to UK conventions
3. **Exceeding 2 pages** — Strong UK convention; 3+ pages is frowned upon for non-academic roles
4. **Including photo, age, or nationality** — Against UK best practice under equality legislation
5. **Generic personal statement** — "Hardworking individual seeking new challenges" is the most common weak opening
6. **Omitting degree classification** — Particularly damaging for early-career candidates with good grades
7. **Using US date format** — mm/dd/yyyy is confusing in UK context; use Month Year
8. **No interests section** — Its omission is noticed and may suggest an incomplete CV
