# Consulting Resume

## What This Document Is

A precisely structured one-page document for management consulting roles at firms like McKinsey, BCG, Bain (MBB), and other strategy consulting firms. The consulting resume follows rigid formatting conventions and is evaluated differently from standard resumes — every line is potential interview material, and the document must demonstrate four specific competencies through achievements rather than descriptions.

## Required Sections

In expected order (education-first is the standard for consulting):

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, LinkedIn. Location optional.
2. **Education** — Listed FIRST, above experience. For each degree:
   - University name, degree, major/concentration, graduation date
   - GPA (expected if 3.5+; omission is noticed)
   - Relevant honors, scholarships, leadership positions within educational context
   - For MBA candidates: pre-MBA employer and GMAT score may be included
3. **Professional Experience** — Reverse-chronological. For each role:
   - Company name, title, location, dates
   - 3-4 bullets, each mapping to a competency category
   - Each bullet: [Action verb] + [specific what] + [quantified result]
4. **Additional Information / Interests** — Single paragraph or short section:
   - Languages (with proficiency level)
   - Technical skills
   - Interests (treated seriously — these become interview conversation topics)

## Optional Sections

- Certifications (CFA, CPA — if relevant to target practice area)
- Publications (for experienced hires with thought leadership)
- Volunteer / pro bono (briefly, if demonstrating leadership)

## Length & Format Rules

- **One page. Non-negotiable.** Even with an MBA and 5+ years of experience.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, education first. Clean, dense, no wasted space.
- **Design**: Black and white only. No color, no graphics, no logos, no design elements.
- **Font**: Standard (Times New Roman, Calibri, Arial). 10-11pt body. Margins can be tightened to 0.5" to fit content.
- **File format**: PDF.

## Content Rules

**Four competency mapping.** Every bullet should demonstrate one of the four core consulting competencies:
- **Problem-solving** — Analytical thinking, structured approach to complex problems
- **Personal impact** — Communication, influence, stakeholder management
- **Entrepreneurial ability** — Initiative, driving results, creating something new
- **Leadership** — Team management, developing others, driving organizational change

**Bullets are interview ammunition.** Consultants should be prepared to discuss every bullet for 5-10 minutes in a PEI (Personal Experience Interview) or FIT interview. Never include anything you can't elaborate on with specific details, challenges, and outcomes.

**Quantification is mandatory.** "Increased sales by 15% ($2M incremental revenue) across 3 regions" not "Helped improve sales performance." Every bullet needs at least one number.

**Interests section is real.** Consulting firms use interests for cultural fit assessment and interview rapport. "Competitive marathon runner (3:15 PR)" is good. "Reading, traveling, cooking" is generic and wasted space. Include specific, distinctive interests with measurable detail where possible.

**Avoid consulting jargon on a consulting resume.** Don't use "drove strategic initiatives" or "leveraged synergies" — the reader IS a consultant and will see through buzzwords. Use specific, concrete language.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Dense, structured bullet format — this is the expected style
- Education-first ordering — standard for consulting, not a formatting error
- Heavy quantification in every bullet — required, not artificial
- Formal, precise language — expected register

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Vague "strategic thinking" or "strategic initiatives" without naming the strategy or initiative
- "Cross-functional collaboration" without naming the functions or the outcome
- Modifier stacking ("highly impactful and deeply analytical")
- Generic consulting buzzwords used on a consulting resume (ironic but a strong tell)
- Bullets that could describe anyone at any company — consulting resumes must be specific

**False positive guidance:**
- GPA display is expected, not boastful
- Education above experience is correct for consulting, not a formatting error
- Interest items with metrics ("ran 12 marathons across 6 countries") are encouraged, not padding
- Tight formatting with small margins is standard, not cramming

## ATS / Evaluation System

Consulting hiring uses standard ATS for initial collection but evaluation is heavily human-driven:

1. **ATS collection** — Resume submitted through firm's career portal (Workday, Taleo)
2. **Recruiter screen** — Quick pass/fail on school, GPA, experience quality
3. **Resume review by consultants** — Partners and principals review resumes; every bullet is evaluated
4. **Case interview + PEI/FIT** — Resume bullets are directly probed in behavioral interviews
5. **Decision committee** — Final hiring decision considers case performance, behavioral fit, and resume strength

**ATS considerations:**
- Standard keyword matching applies at intake
- School name and GPA are primary screening criteria for campus recruiting
- For experienced hires, company pedigree and quantified impact matter most
- The ATS stage is a low bar — the real evaluation is human

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Undergraduate / Campus | No full-time experience | 1 page, education-heavy, internships + activities |
| Post-MBA / Advanced Degree | MBA + pre-MBA experience | 1 page, education first, pre-MBA experience reframed |
| Experienced Hire (3-7 years) | Industry expertise, no MBA required | 1 page, experience-heavy, domain expertise clear |
| Senior Hire (8+ years) | Practice leadership, deep domain | 1 page, selective highlights, thought leadership |
| Partner-track / Principal | Client relationships, revenue generation | Still 1 page for formal applications, though often bypasses formal process |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Exceeding one page** — Immediate disqualification signal, regardless of experience level
2. **Experience before education** — For consulting, education leads. Always.
3. **Generic interests** — "Travel, reading, music" wastes valuable space. Be specific and distinctive.
4. **Bullets without numbers** — Every consulting bullet needs quantified impact
5. **Consulting buzzwords on a consulting resume** — Using "synergy" and "leverage" to impress consultants backfires
6. **Not mapping to competencies** — Bullets should clearly demonstrate problem-solving, impact, entrepreneurship, or leadership
7. **Including a summary or objective** — Unnecessary and space-wasting on a consulting resume
8. **Omitting GPA** — If it's above 3.5, include it. If omitted, the reader assumes it's below 3.5.
