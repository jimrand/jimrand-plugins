# Investment Banking / Private Equity Resume

## What This Document Is

A strictly formatted one-page document for investment banking (IB), private equity (PE), hedge fund, and corporate finance roles. The resume is built around deal experience and financial modeling capability. Unlike standard resumes that emphasize general achievements, IB/PE resumes center on specific transactions — the deal name, type, size, your role, and outcome are the core content.

## Required Sections

In expected order:

1. **Header** — Name, phone, email, LinkedIn. Location optional.
2. **Education** — Listed first for campus and post-MBA recruiting:
   - University name, degree, major/concentration, graduation date
   - GPA (expected if 3.5+)
   - Relevant honors, scholarships
   - SAT scores (for some undergraduate recruiting at top firms — increasingly less common)
3. **Professional Experience** — Reverse-chronological. For each role:
   - Firm name, group/division, title, location, dates
   - 2-3 bullets describing general responsibilities and skills
   - **Deal Experience** subsection: specific transactions worked on
4. **Deal Experience** (may be integrated into experience or standalone):
   - Transaction name or descriptor (respecting confidentiality)
   - Deal type: M&A, IPO, LBO, debt financing, restructuring, etc.
   - Deal size (enterprise value, transaction value)
   - Status: Closed, Announced, Pending
   - Your specific role and contributions
5. **Additional Information** — Single section at bottom:
   - Languages (with proficiency level)
   - Technical skills (financial modeling: DCF, LBO, comps, accretion/dilution)
   - Certifications (CFA, Series 7/63, etc.)
   - Interests (brief, specific)

## Optional Sections

- Coursework (for campus recruits, if relevant finance/accounting courses)
- Leadership activities (for campus recruits)
- Volunteer work (briefly, if relevant)

## Length & Format Rules

- **One page. Non-negotiable.** Even managing directors typically use one page for formal applications.
- **Format**: Reverse-chronological, education first for campus/post-MBA, experience first for lateral moves.
- **Design**: Black and white, no color, no graphics. Clean and dense.
- **Font**: Times New Roman or similar serif. 10-10.5pt body. Margins may tighten to 0.5" to fit content.
- **File format**: PDF.
- **Deal table formatting**: Deal experience is often presented in a mini-table format within the resume (transaction | type | size | status).

## Content Rules

**Deal experience is the centerpiece.** The deals you've worked on define your candidacy. Prioritize "Closed" transactions over "Announced" over "Pending." For each deal, state the transaction type, size, and your specific contribution.

**Financial modeling skills are listed explicitly.** Name the model types: DCF (Discounted Cash Flow), LBO (Leveraged Buyout), Comparable Company Analysis, Precedent Transaction Analysis, Accretion/Dilution. This is not jargon stuffing — it signals specific technical proficiency.

**Confidentiality in deal descriptions.** If the deal is public, name it. If not, describe it generically: "Advised a $500M technology company on its sale to a strategic acquirer." Never name confidential clients.

**Activities/interests hierarchy.** The additional section follows a specific priority order: Languages (most valuable) → Technical Skills → Certifications → Coursework → Interests. Space is tight — each item must earn its place.

**Quantify everything.** Revenue, deal sizes, number of pitches, models built, presentations delivered. The finance industry is numbers-driven at every level.

## AI Detection Calibration

**Reduce sensitivity for:**
- Transaction-specific language and financial terminology — Expected and required
- Dense, numbers-heavy formatting — Standard for finance resumes
- Formal, precise descriptions — Expected register
- Repetitive deal description structure — Deals are legitimately described in parallel format
- Acronyms (M&A, DCF, LBO, IPO, PE) — Standard industry shorthand

**Increase sensitivity for:**
- Vague "strategic" claims without naming the strategy or transaction type
- "Drove value creation" without quantifying the value or naming the mechanism
- "Collaborated with senior leadership" without naming the outcome or your specific role
- Modifier stacking ("highly analytical and deeply strategic")
- Generic descriptions that don't reference specific deals, models, or analyses
- "Proven track record in financial services" — Cliché that names nothing specific

**False positive guidance:**
- Deal descriptions that follow identical structures are convention, not mechanical repetition
- Listing 5-8 deals in a single role is standard, not padding
- Technical skills listing (DCF, LBO, comps) is a required convention, not keyword stuffing
- GPA and test score display is expected, not boastful

## ATS / Evaluation System

Mixed system depending on firm type and hiring channel:

1. **Campus recruiting** — Applications through firm portals. Recruiter screen on GPA, school, internships. Interviews include technical questions (valuation, accounting, LBO) and behavioral fit.
2. **Lateral recruiting (IB)** — Headhunter-driven. Recruiters source candidates and present directly to group heads. Resume may never touch an ATS.
3. **PE recruiting** — Extremely headhunter-driven, often on compressed timelines ("on-cycle" recruiting). Technical modeling tests are standard.
4. **Direct application** — Some firms accept direct applications through ATS (Workday, Taleo).

**When ATS IS involved:**
- Financial keyword matching: deal types, modeling skills, certifications
- School name and GPA are primary screening criteria
- Firm name recognition matters (Goldman, Morgan Stanley, etc. as prior employers)

## Career Level Mapping

| Level | Markers | Resume Expectations |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Analyst (0-3 years) | Junior, execution-focused | 1 page, education prominent, internships + analyst deals |
| Associate (3-5 years, post-MBA or promote) | Deal execution, some client interaction | 1 page, deal experience central, modeling expertise |
| VP (5-8 years) | Deal management, client relationships | 1 page, selective deal highlights, leadership in transactions |
| Director / ED (8-12 years) | Origination, client coverage | 1 page, deal origination and relationship focus |
| Managing Director (12+ years) | Revenue generation, relationship management | 1 page for formal applications; tombstone sheets for client presentations |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Exceeding one page** — Immediate negative signal in finance
2. **Vague deal descriptions** — "Worked on M&A transactions" vs. "Advised on the $1.2B sale of [Company] to [Acquirer], including financial modeling, due diligence coordination, and management presentation preparation"
3. **Missing deal sizes** — Transaction value is essential context
4. **Not distinguishing Closed vs. Pending** — Status matters and should be clearly indicated
5. **Omitting technical skills** — Assume the reader wants to know exactly which models you can build
6. **Generic experience descriptions** — Every bullet should reference specific analyses, deals, or deliverables
7. **Including a summary or objective** — Wastes space on a one-page finance resume
8. **Listing "Microsoft Office" as a skill** — Assumed; list Bloomberg, Capital IQ, FactSet, or specific modeling tools instead
