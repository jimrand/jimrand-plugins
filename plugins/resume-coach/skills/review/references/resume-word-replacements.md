## Context-Dependent Words

**"Ensure"** — AI uses it for everything. Fine in compliance/legal contexts. Replace with "make sure" in general use.

**"Implement"** — Appropriate in technical contexts. AI overuses it: "implemented a morning routine" should be "started daily standups."

**"Key" (adjective)** — AI puts "key" before everything. Cut most: "key metrics" becomes "metrics." "Key stakeholders" — name them.

**"Critical" / "Crucial" / "Essential"** — When everything is critical, nothing is. Use sparingly.

**"Strategic"** — Appropriate at director+ level for actual strategy work. AI uses it for everything.

## AI Filler Affirmations — Always Cut

These add no information and signal AI:

- "Great question!"
- "Absolutely!"
- "That's a really interesting point."
- "I'm glad you asked."

These appear in cover letters and LinkedIn posts more than resumes, but flag them if found.
