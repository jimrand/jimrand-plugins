## Context-Dependent Words

**"Ensure"** — AI uses it for everything. Fine in compliance/legal contexts. Replace with "make sure" in general use.

**"Implement"** — Appropriate in technical contexts. AI overuses it: "implemented a morning routine" should be "started daily standups."

**"Key" (adjective)** — AI puts "key" before everything. Cut most: "key metrics" becomes "metrics." "Key stakeholders" — name them.

**"Critical" / "Crucial" / "Essential"** — When everything is critical, nothing is. Use sparingly.

**"Strategic"** — Appropriate at director+ level for actual strategy work. AI uses it for everything.

## AI Filler Affirmations — Always Cut

These add no information and signal AI:

- "Great question!"
- "Absolutely!"
- "That's a really interesting point."
- "I'm glad you asked."

These appear in cover letters and LinkedIn posts more than resumes, but flag them if found.

## Copula Avoidance Patterns — Restore Simple Verbs

AI systematically avoids "is," "has," "are," and "was." In resumes, this appears as:

| AI version | Human version |
|---|---|
| Serves as the primary point of contact for... | Is the primary contact for... |
| Stands as a testament to the team's dedication | Shows the team's dedication |
| Boasts an impressive portfolio of... | Has a portfolio of... (or cut "impressive") |
| Features a comprehensive suite of... | Has / Includes |
| Holds significance as a... | Is a... / Matters because... |
| Represents a cornerstone of... | Is central to / Is a key part of |
| Functions as the lead for... | Is the lead for... / Leads |
| Plays a pivotal role in... | Is important to / Shapes / Drives |

Note: "Served as" is standard federal resume phrasing and should NOT be flagged in federal resumes.

## Participial Phrase Alternatives

AI overuses "-ing" constructions, especially at the start of bullet points:

| AI version | Fix |
|---|---|
| Leveraging decades of experience, led... | Led [specific initiative], drawing on [specific experience] |
| Driving strategic initiatives across... | Drove [specific initiative] across [named teams] |
| Delivering measurable results through... | Delivered [specific result] through [specific method] |
| Building on previous successes, developed... | Developed [specific thing] after [specific prior success] |
| Showcasing a commitment to quality, implemented... | Implemented [specific quality measure] |

Don't eliminate all participial phrases — one or two per resume is fine. The tell is frequency and clustering.

### Em Dash Decision Framework

When you encounter an em dash in resume text, ask: what is the grammatical relationship?

| Relationship | Replace with | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Non-restrictive aside | Commas or parentheses | "The team — which grew to 15 — delivered on time" → "The team, which grew to 15, delivered on time" |
| Introducing a list | Colon | "Three priorities — speed, quality, and cost" → "Three priorities: speed, quality, and cost" |
| Independent clauses | Period or semicolon | "Revenue grew 20% — the team expanded" → "Revenue grew 20%. The team expanded." |
| Simple attribution | Comma | "The CEO — Maria Chen — announced" → "The CEO, Maria Chen, announced" |
| Genuine interruption | Keep the em dash | (Rare in resumes — almost never appropriate) |
