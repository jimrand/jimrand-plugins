# Resume AI Patterns

Detecting AI-generated writing in resumes, organized by four categories of tells.

## Structural Tells

### Formulaic Paragraph Structure
AI summaries follow a predictable pattern: [Bold claim] then [Supporting detail], repeated identically. Human summaries vary their approach — leading with a number, a story, or a short declarative statement.

**Signal**: Every sentence in a section follows the same arc (noun phrase opener, comma, elaboration).

### Symmetrical Groupings
AI loves groups of three with parallel structure. When every list has exactly three items with identical grammatical form, the rhythm becomes mechanical.

**Signal**: Repeating groups of three with identical structure throughout the resume.

### Uniform Bullet Length
Human bullets naturally vary — some are one line, some are three. AI produces bullets that are all approximately the same length.

**Signal**: All bullets in a section are within 20% of the same word count.

### Predictable Section Balance
AI gives each role roughly the same emphasis regardless of relevance. A human weights recent and relevant roles heavily and condenses older ones.

**Signal**: A 15-year-old role has the same number of bullets as the current role.

## Lexical Tells

### AI-Favorite Power Verbs
These verbs appear far more often in AI-generated resumes:

- **Spearheaded** — AI's default for "led"
- **Championed** — AI's default for advocacy
- **Orchestrated** — AI's default for coordination
- **Pioneered** — AI's default for anything new
- **Revolutionized** — hyperbolic in almost any corporate context

One of these is fine. Three or more signals generation.

### Resume Cliche Phrases
These appear overwhelmingly in AI-generated resumes:

- "Proven track record of delivering..."
- "Results-oriented professional..."
- "Passionate about [domain]..."
- "Self-motivated team player..."
- "Dynamic and detail-oriented..."
- "Leveraged best practices to..."
- "In a fast-paced environment..."
- "Exceeded expectations consistently..."
- "Trusted advisor to senior leadership..."

Three or more of these in the same resume is a strong AI signal.

### Modifier Stacking
AI stacks adjectives and adverbs where one would do:

- "Highly innovative and cutting-edge"
- "Truly exceptional and outstanding"
- "Comprehensive and thorough"
- "Significant and substantial"
- "Rigorous and meticulous"

**Fix**: Keep the strongest modifier, cut the rest.

### Buzzword Density
AI packs multiple buzzwords into single phrases:

- "Strategic implementations of generative AI solutions"
- "Data-driven optimization through cross-functional synergies"
- "Innovative approaches to digital transformation initiatives"

**Signal**: Three or more buzzwords within a single noun phrase.

### AI Connector Words
Resume-specific AI connectors that signal generation when they appear repeatedly:

- "Enabling..." (trailing clause)
- "Resulting in..."
- "Driving [vague noun]..."
- "Delivering [vague noun]..."
- "Through strategic [noun]..."
- "By leveraging [noun]..."

## Rhetorical Tells

### Unearned Authority
AI makes bold claims without evidence:

- "Proven expertise in..." — prove it with a number
- "Demonstrated ability to..." — demonstrate it with an example
- "Deep understanding of..." — show the understanding through work
- "Exceptional ability to..." — let results be exceptional

**Fix**: Cut the claiming phrase, lead with evidence.

### Vague Authority Endings
AI bullets start strong (specific work) and end weak (vague impact):

- "...directly influencing C-suite strategic decisions"
- "...driving organizational excellence"
- "...aligning teams with business objectives"
- "...delivering measurable business impact"
- "...establishing a foundation for future growth"

**Fix**: Name the specific decision, outcome, or metric. If you can't, cut the ending.

### Empty Summarization
AI adds summary sentences that restate what was already said:

- "This resulted in significant improvements across the organization."
- "These efforts collectively contributed to the team's success."

**Fix**: Cut the summary sentence. The bullets already made the point.

### Emotional Flattening
AI-generated resumes have no personality. Every sentence sits at the same mild, impressive temperature. There's no hint of what the person cares about or what distinguishes their voice.

**Signal**: The resume could describe anyone in the field with similar tenure.

## Sentence-Level Tells

### Uniform Sentence Length
Human writing has rhythm — long followed by short, fragments, punchy closers. AI produces sentences all roughly the same length.

**Signal**: All sentences in a section are 20-30 words with no variation.

### Passive Voice Overuse
Some passive voice is normal in resumes, but AI overuses it:

- "A new system was designed and implemented" vs. "Built a new system"
- "Key improvements were identified" vs. "Identified three areas for improvement"

**Signal**: More than 30% of bullets use passive construction.

### Noun Phrase Pileups
AI chains multiple words before the main noun:

- "Advanced predictive analytics capabilities"
- "Comprehensive enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives"
- "Executive-level strategic recommendation framework"

**Signal**: Four or more words stacked before a noun.

## Calibration Notes

### What NOT to Flag
Some patterns are standard resume conventions, not AI tells:
- Fragment-style openers ("Led a team of...") — normal resume style
- Action verb starts on every bullet — expected
- Quantified results — humans do this too
- Industry jargon — appropriate in context

### Career Level Considerations
- **Entry-level**: AI tells are common because candidates have less substance. Flag but be generous.
- **Mid-level**: Most common level for AI generation. Apply full scrutiny.
- **Senior/Executive**: Some formality that looks AI-generated is appropriate. "Established a governance framework" is fine for a VP. Focus on substance over style at this level.
