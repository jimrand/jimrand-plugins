# Resume Expectations by Career Level

How resume structure, tone, and emphasis should shift across career levels.

## Entry-Level (0-3 years)

### Structure
- **Summary/Objective**: Brief, forward-looking. States target role and what they bring.
- **Education**: Prominent (can be above experience for recent graduates)
- **Experience**: Internships, part-time roles, projects, relevant coursework
- **Skills**: Important — demonstrates capability work history may not yet prove
- **Length**: 1 page maximum

### Tone
- Eager but not desperate
- Specific about contributions even in small roles
- Forward-looking language is acceptable here
- Should NOT try to sound like a senior leader

### What to Watch For
- AI generation is common because candidates have less to say
- Overinflated language ("spearheaded" a class project) is a strong tell
- Generic claims without specifics add nothing
- Buzzword stuffing to fill space

### What Good Looks Like
- Specific contributions in internships and projects
- Quantified results even if small
- Relevant coursework and projects demonstrating capability
- Clean, simple language that does not overclaim

## Mid-Level (3-8 years)

### Structure
- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences. Role identity, domain, key differentiator.
- **Experience**: Primary section. 3-5 bullets per role.
- **Skills**: Organized by category. Demonstrates breadth.
- **Education**: Below experience.
- **Length**: 1-2 pages

### Tone
- Confident but grounded
- Ownership language ("led," "built," "designed") for appropriate scope
- Should show growing responsibility across roles
- Balance technical depth and business awareness

### What to Watch For
- Most common level for AI-generated resumes
- "Proven track record" and "results-oriented" especially common
- Bullets that describe duties instead of achievements
- Uniform language across all roles

### What Good Looks Like
- Clear progression in scope and responsibility
- Each role tells a different story
- Mix of technical achievements and business outcomes
- Some personality — a specific project or challenge that stands out

## Senior (8-15 years)

### Structure
- **Executive Summary**: 3-5 sentences. Expertise, scale of impact, leadership.
- **Core Competencies**: Optional but useful — signals leadership domains
- **Experience**: 4-6 bullets per recent role, 2-3 for older roles
- **Skills**: Organized by category. Can include Strategy subcategory.
- **Education**: Brief, at the bottom.
- **Length**: 2 pages

### Tone
- Authoritative without arrogance
- Leadership framing ("built the team," "established the function")
- Strategic language appropriate but must be backed by specifics
- Less "what I built with my hands" and more "what I built and what it was worth"

### What to Watch For
- AI generation often sounds like a LinkedIn About section
- Vague authority claims without naming decisions
- Every bullet starting with "Led"
- Emotional flattening — no sense of what this person cares about

### What Good Looks Like
- Clear narrative of increasing scope and organizational impact
- Named stakeholders, specific decisions, concrete outcomes
- Balance between leadership and technical credibility
- A point of view about their domain

## Executive (15+ years)

### Structure
- **Executive Summary**: 4-6 sentences. Career story — where they have been, what they built, where they are going. Should be distinctive.
- **Core Competencies**: Expected. Signals leadership domains.
- **Experience**: 5-7 bullets for key roles, 2-3 for older roles. Early career condensed.
- **Technical Skills**: Optional but useful for technical executives. Separate from Competencies.
- **Education**: Brief, at the bottom.
- **Length**: 2-3 pages (3 acceptable for 20+ year careers)

### Tone
- Confident, understated authority
- Organization-building language ("founded the function," "grew the team from X to Y")
- Board-level communication style — concise, outcome-focused
- Some formality is appropriate and expected
- Should NOT sound like a mid-level resume with bigger numbers

### What to Watch For
- AI executive summaries are extremely common and generic
- "Visionary leader" / "transformational executive" — empty self-assessment
- Every role at the same temperature — no narrative arc
- Competencies listing technical skills instead of leadership domains
- Profile sections that repeat the Summary

### What Good Looks Like
- A career story, not a list of jobs
- Specific organizational impact: built teams, entered markets, drove revenue
- Concise older roles — old IC roles need 1-2 bullets, not 6
- The summary makes the reader want to talk to this person
- Mentorship and team development with specifics (programs, pipelines, outcomes)

## Cross-Level Rules

### Universal Red Flags
- Job duties instead of achievements
- Missing quantification (50%+ of bullets should have numbers)
- Inconsistent tense (past for past roles, present for current)
- Redundancy between sections
- Skills listed but not evidenced in experience

### The Formality Gradient

| Level | Appropriate Formality |
|---|---|
| Entry | Direct, active, slightly eager |
| Mid | Confident, professional, specific |
| Senior | Authoritative, strategic, measured |
| Executive | Commanding, concise, narrative-driven |

Each level up means more perspective and less need to prove. An executive does not say "proven track record" — the track record is the resume itself.
